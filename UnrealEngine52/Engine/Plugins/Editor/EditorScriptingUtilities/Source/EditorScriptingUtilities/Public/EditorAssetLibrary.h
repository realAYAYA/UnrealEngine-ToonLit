 * Utility class to do most of the common functionalities with the ContentBrowser.
 * The AssetRegistryHelpers class has more complex utilities. Use FindAssetData to get a FAssetData from an Asset Path.
 * The Asset Path can be represented by 
 *		ie. (Reference/Text Path)	StaticMesh'/Game/MyFolder/MyAsset.MyAsset'
 *		ie. (Full Name)				StaticMesh /Game/MyFolder/MyAsset.MyAsset
 *		ie. (Path Name)				/Game/MyFolder/MyAsset.MyAsset
 *		ie. (Package Name)			/Game/MyFolder/MyAsset
 * The Directory Path can be represented by
 *		ie. /Game/MyNewFolder/
 *		ie. /Game/MyNewFolder
 * All operations can be slow. The editor should not be in play in editor mode. It will not work on assets of the type level.
