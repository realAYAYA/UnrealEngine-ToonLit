/**
 * FLevelObjectsObserver is a utility class that tracks the active-set of Actors
 * in a World, in the Editor, and emits events when the set changes. The goal is to
 * guarantee that:
 *   - OnActorAdded will be emitted when an Actor comes into existence
 *   - OnActorRemoved will be emitted when an Actor ceases to exist (possibly after GC, though)
 *   - these signals will be unique, ie once per Actor
 * 
 * This is a surprisingly complicated problem in the Editor due to the many ways
 * that Actors might be created or destroyed, in particular via Undo/Redo. 
 *
 * Note that it is not possible to guarantee that OnActorRemoved() fires before an Actor
 * is GC'd. So, listeners should maintain TWeakObjectPtr<>'s on Actors if they need
 * to know this information.
