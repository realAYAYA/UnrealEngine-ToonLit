/**
 * Output Media for SharedMemory.
 * 
 * The pixels are captured into shared cross gpu textures, that a player can read.
 * Inter-process communication happens via shared system memory. The metadata exchanged is documented 
 * in the FSharedMemoryMediaFrameMetadata structure. The shared memory can be located via a UniqueName
 * that must match in the Media Output and corresponding Media Source settings.
 * 
 * It is mostly intended for use in nDisplay render nodes, which are designed to be frame-locked.
