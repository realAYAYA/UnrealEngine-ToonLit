 * The level sequence that the recording is being placed into is provided so that the take can decide
 * to store the data directly in the resulting level sequence, but sources are not limited to generating
 * data in the specified Level Sequence. The source should be registered with the ITakeRecorderModule for
 * it to show up in the Take Recorder UI. If creating a recording setup via code you can just add instances
 * of your Source to the UTakeRecorderSources instance you're using to record and skip registering them with
 * the module.
 *
 * Sources should reset their state before recording as there is not a guarantee that the object will be newly
