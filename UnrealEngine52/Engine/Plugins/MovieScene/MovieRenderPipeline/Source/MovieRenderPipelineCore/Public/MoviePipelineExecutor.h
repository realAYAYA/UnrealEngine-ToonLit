* A Movie Pipeline Executor is responsible for executing an array of Movie Pipelines,

* on them serially, but you can create an implementation of this class, change the 
* default in the Project Settings and use your own distribution logic. For example,
* you may want to distribute the work to multiple computers over a network, which
* may involve running command line options on each machine to sync the latest content
