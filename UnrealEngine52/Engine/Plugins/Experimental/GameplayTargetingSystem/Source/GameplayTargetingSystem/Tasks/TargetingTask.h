/**
*	@class UTargetingTask
*
*	The base object type that all Targeting Tasks will derive from. The idea
*	is the targeting system will take target requests that are collections of
*	target tasks that will potentially generate/remove and perform operations
*	on sets of targeting results data.
*
*	Potential Task Implementations:
*
*	Selection Tasks:
*	Target selection tasks would be used to build up a collection of target
*	request results. It is recommend they are added first in the targeting
*	request. Things like ray casts, AOE shapes, actors under a reticle, etc
*	are cases that generally fall under selection.
*
*	Filtering Tasks:
*	Target filtering tasks are used to reduce the target result data set to
*	those targets that match a given criteria. Things like actor class, team
*	distance, facing, etc.
*
*	Sorting Tasks:
*	Target sorting tasks would be useful to take the set and put them in an order
*	the end user might prefer to make decisions on. Distance (min/max), score rating
*	etc.
