/** 
 * The actual asset editor class doesn't have that much in it, intentionally. 
 * 
 * Our current asset editor guidelines ask us to place as little business logic as possible
 * into the class, instead putting as much of the non-UI code into the subsystem as possible,
 * and the UI code into the toolkit (which this class owns).
 *
 * However, since we're using a mode and the Interactive Tools Framework, a lot of our business logic
 * ends up inside the mode and the tools, not the subsystem. The front-facing code is mostly in
 * the asset editor toolkit, though the mode toolkit has most of the things that deal with the toolbar
 * on the left.
