 * Submit delegate handlers to listen for actors of a given class. Those handlers will automatically run when actors of a given class or registered as receivers or game events are sent.
 * Actors must opt-in to this behavior by calling AddReceiver/RemoveReceiver for themselves when they are ready to receive the components and when they want to remove them.
 * Any actors that are in memory when a request is made will automatically get the components, and any in memory when a request is removed will lose the components immediately.
 * Requests are reference counted, so if multiple requests are made for the same actor class and component class, only one component will be added and that component wont be removed until all requests are removed.
