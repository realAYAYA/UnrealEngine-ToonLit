# This file contains filter rules for files to transfer to the remote Mac for compilation. Since UHT is also executed remotely, it needs everything to require that on Mac.
# 
# Syntax is described here: https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.html
# 
# Note that:
#  * For any directory or file that is checked against this list, patterns are compared in order and the first matching rule applies (ie. subsequent inversions of that rule will be ignored)
#  * Directories will not be recursed through unless their parent directories match a rule.
#  * If directories match a protect rule, it applies to the entire directory and short-circuits traversal of the contents.
