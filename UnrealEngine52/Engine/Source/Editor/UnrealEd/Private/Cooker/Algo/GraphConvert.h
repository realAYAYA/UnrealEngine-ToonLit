 * Convert an array of Keys and a function that returns the directed edges from each Key into the Normalized Graph
 * Form. Normalized Graph Form is an implicit set of vertices identified as integers from 0 to N - 1, and an array of
 * arrayviews of edges from each vertex. The Normalized Graph form has two structures: The GraphBuffer which contains
 * the memory storage for the Graph and the Graph itself which is the array of arrayviews of edges. The length of the
 * array in the graph defines the number of vertices.
 * 
 * @param UniqueKeys A range with element type KeyType. KeyType must support GetTypeHash and copy+move constructors.
 *        KeyType being pointertype is recommended. Keys in the range must be unique. The ith element of the range
 *        will correspond to as vertex i in the OutGraph. UniqueKeys must have length < MAX_int32.
 * @param GetKeyEdges A callable with prototype that is one of
 *            RangeType<KeyType> GetKeyEdges(const KeyType& Key);
 *            const RangeType<KeyType>& GetKeyEdges(const KeyType& Key);
 *        It must return the TargetKeys that are pointed to from the directed edges from Key. TargetKeys that are 
 *        not elements of UniqueKeys will be discarded. RangeType must support ranged-for (begin() and end()).
 * @param OutGraphBuffer Output value that holds the memory used by the graph. The array must remain allocated and
 *        unmodified until OutGraph is no longer referenced.
 * @param OutGraph Output value that holds the graph. OutGraph[i] is a TConstArrayView of edges from Vertex i, which
 *        corresponds to UniqueKeys[i]. Each element of OutGraph[i] is a an FVertex which when cast to an integer is
 *        the index into UniqueKeys that corresponds to the vertex. Elements of OutGraph[i] are sorted by FVertex
 *        value, aka the index into UniqueKeys.
 * @param Options for the conversion, @see EConvertToGraphOptions.
