/**
 * This is the base widget type for all views that exist on a curve editor panel. A view may contain 0 or more curves (stored in CurveInfoByID).
 * SCurveEditorViews are directly housed within a single SCurveEditorViewContainer which arranges each view vertically in order.
 *
 * View types:
 *		A view may have a centrally registered ID (See FCurveEditorViewRegistry and FCurveModel::GetSupportedViews) which allows any external curve model type to express support for any other view type.
 *		3 built-in views are provided:
 *			Absolute:   Shows 1 or more curves on a single 2D-scrollable grid using a single zoomable view-space.
 *			Normalized: Shows 1 or more curves on a single grid scrollable horizontally with all curves normalized to the extents of the view
 *			Stacked:    Shows 1 or more curves on separate fixed-height grids scrollable horizontally each curve normalized to the extents of its own grid
 *		Unregistered curve views may still be added to the view by calling SCurveEditorPanel::AddView
 *
 * Space Transformations:
 *		Views must define a valid 2-dimensional space (ViewSpace) that is used to convert from a pixel position to the virtual view space.
 *		Views may additionally implement per-curve transformations from view space to curve space, to allow for specific layouts/scales of curves within them.
 *		Per-curve transforms are stored inside FCurveInfo::ViewToCurveTransform
 *
 * Sizing:
 *		Views may be size in one of 2 ways:
 *			* Auto sized (bAutoSize=true): views derive their height from the widget's desired size;
 *			* Stretched (bAutoSize=false): views will be stretched to the size of the parent panel with a sensible minimum height.
