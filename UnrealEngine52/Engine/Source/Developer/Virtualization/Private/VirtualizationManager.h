/**
 * Configuring the backend hierarchy
 * 
 * The [Core.ContentVirtualization] section can contain a string 'BackendGraph' which will set with the name of  
 * the backend graph, if not set then the default 'ContentVirtualizationBackendGraph_None' will be used instead. 
 * This value can also be overridden from the command line by using 'BackendGraph=FooBar' where FooBar is the 
 * name of the graph.
 * 
 * The first entry in the graph to be parsed will be the 'Hierarchy' which describes which backends should be
 * mounted and in which order. For example 'Hierarchy=(Entry=Foo, Entry=Bar)' which should mount two backends
 * 'Foo' and 'Bar' in that order. 
 * 
 * Each referenced backend in the hierarchy will then require it's own entry in the graph where the key will be
 * it's name in the hierarchy and the value a string describing how to set it up. 
 * The value must contain 'Type=X' where X is the name used to find the correct IVirtualizationBackendFactory 
 * to create the backend with. 
 * Once the backend is created then reset of the string will be passed to it, so that additional customization
 * can be extracted. Depending on the backend implementation these values may or may not be required.
 * 
 * Example graph:
 * [ContentVirtualizationBackendGraph_Example] 
 * Hierarchy=(Entry=MemoryCache, Entry=NetworkShare)
 * MemoryCache=(Type=InMemory)
 * NetworkShare=(Type=FileSystem, Path="\\path\to\somewhere")
 * 
 * The graph is named 'ContentVirtualizationBackendGraph_Example'.
 * The hierarchy contains two entries 'InMemory' and 'NetworkShare' to be mounted in that order
 * MemoryCache creates a backend of type 'InMemory' and has no additional customization
 * NetworkShare creates a backend of type 'FileSystem' and provides an additional path, the filesystem backend would 
 * fatal error without this value.

/**
 * Filtering
 * 
 * When pushing a payload it can be filtered based on the path of the package it belongs to. The filtering options 
 * are set up via the config files. 
 * Note that this only affects pushing a payload, if the filtering for a project is changed to exclude a package that
 * is already virtualized it will still be able to pull it's payloads as needed but will store them locally in the 
 * package the next time that it is saved.
 * @see ShouldVirtualizePackage or ShouldVirtualize for implementation details.
 * 
 * Basic Setup:
 * 
 * [Core.ContentVirtualization]
 * FilterMode=OptIn/OptOut					When 'OptIn' payloads will be virtualized by default, when 'OptOut' they will not be virtualized by default
 * FilterEngineContent=True/False			When true any payload from a package under Engine/Content/.. will be excluded from virtualization
 * FilterEnginePluginContent=True/False		When true any payload from a package under Engine/Plugins/../Content/.. will be excluded from virtualization
 * FilterMapContent=True/False				When true any payload stored in a .umap or _BuildData.uasset file will be excluded from virtualization
 * LazyInitConnections=True/False			When true the backends will not try to make their connections until first used.
 * 
 * PackagePath Setup:
 * 
 * In addition to the default filtering mode set above, payloads stored in packages can be filtered based on the
 * package path. This allows a package to be including in the virtualization process or excluded from it.
 * 
 * Note that these paths will be stored in the ini files under the Saved directory. To remove a path make sure to 
 * use the - syntax to remove the entry from the array, rather than removing the line itself. Otherwise it will
 * persist until the saved config file has been reset.
 *
 * [/Script/Virtualization.VirtualizationFilterSettings]
 * +ExcludePackagePaths="/MountPoint/PathToExclude/"				Excludes any package found under '/MountPoint/PathToExclude/' from the virtualization process
 * +ExcludePackagePaths="/MountPoint/PathTo/ThePackageToExclude"	Excludes the specific package '/MountPoint/PathTo/ThePackageToExclude' from the virtualization process
 * +IncludePackagePaths="/MountPoint/PathToInclude/"				Includes any package found under '/MountPoint/PathToInclude/' in the virtualization process
 * +IncludePackagePaths="/MountPoint/PathTo/ThePackageToInclude"	Includes the specific package '/MountPoint/PathTo/ThePackageToInclude' in the virtualization process
