/**
 * This backend can be used to access payloads stored in source control.
 * The backend doesn't 'check out' a payload file but instead will just download the payload as
 * a binary blob.
 * It is assumed that the files are stored with the same path convention as the file system
 * backend, found in Utils::PayloadIdToPath.
 *
 * Ini file setup:
 * 'Name'=(Type=P4SourceControl, DepotRoot="//XXX/", UsePartitionedClient=X, SubmitFromTempDir=X)
 * Where 'Name' is the backend name in the hierarchy and 'XXX' is the path in the source control
 * depot where the payload files are being stored.
 * 
 * Optional Values:
 * Server [string]:				When set the backend will use this server address to connect to. When not
 *								set the backend will use the environment defaults. [Default=""]
 * ClientStream [string]:		Used when the payloads are stored in a stream based depot. It should contain
 *								the stream name to use when creating a workspace for payload submission. [Default=""]
 * UsePartitionedClient [bool]:	When true the temporary workspace client created to submit payloads 
 *								from will be created as a partitioned workspace which is less overhead
 *								on the source control server. If your server does not support this then
 *								use false. [Default=True]
 * SubmitFromTempDir [bool]:	When set to true, payloads will be submitted from the temp directory of
 *								the current machine and when false the files will be submitted from the
 *								Save directory of the current project. [Default=false]
 * RetryCount [int32]:			How many times we should try to download a payload before giving up with
 *								an error. Useful when the connection is unreliable but does not experience 
 *								frequent persistent outages. [Default=2]
 * RetryWaitTime [int32]:		The length of time the process should wait between each download attempt
 *								in milliseconds. Remember that the max length of time that the process
 *								can stall attempting to download a payload file is 
 *								RetryCount * RetryWaitTime; [Default=100ms]
 * MaxConnections [int32]		The maximum number of perforce connections that can be made concurrently. 
 *								If this value is exceeded then additional requests will wait until a 
 *								connection becomes free. Pass in '-1' to disable this feature and allow
 *								unlimited connections. [Default=8]
 * BatchCount [int32]			The max number of payloads that can be pushed to source control in a
 *								single submit. If the number of payloads in a request batch exceeds
 *								this size then it will be split into multiple smaller batches. [Default=100]
 * SuppressNotifications[bool]:	When true the system will not display a pop up notification when a 
 *								connection error occurs, allowing the user to stay unaware of the error
 *								unless it actually causes some sort of problem. [Default=false]
 * 
 * Environment Variables:
 * UE-VirtualizationWorkingDir [string]:	This can be set to a valid directory path that the backend
 *											should use as the root location to submit payloads from.
 *											If the users machine has this set then 'SubmitFromTempDir' 
 *											will be ignored. 
 * 
 * Perforce Setup
 * The backend will attempt to use the current global environment settings for perforce to determine 
 * the P4PORT and P4USER values. If you wish to set them via an ini file then they can be done per
 * user by adding the following to Saved\Config\<platform>Editor\SourceControlSettings.ini
 * 
 * -----
 * [PerforceSourceControl.VirtualizationSettings]
 * Port=<server address>
 * UserName=<username>
 * -----
 * Note that the backend will read from these ini file settings but will not write to them.
