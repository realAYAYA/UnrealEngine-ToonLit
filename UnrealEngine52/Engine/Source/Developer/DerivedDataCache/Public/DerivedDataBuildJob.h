 * A build job is responsible for the execution of one build.

 * if the action was found in the cache or if the scheduler finds duplicate jobs for a definition
 * or an action.
 *
 * The job depends on the build scheduler to move it through its states. That relationship allows
 * the scheduler more control over resources such as: memory, compute, storage, network.
