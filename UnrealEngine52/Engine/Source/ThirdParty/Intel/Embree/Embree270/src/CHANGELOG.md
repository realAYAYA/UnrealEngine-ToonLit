### New Features in Embree 2.6.1

-   Major performance improvements for ray tracing subdivision surfaces,
    e.g. up to 2× faster for scenes where only the tessellation levels
    are changing per frame, and up to 3× faster for scenes with lots of
    crease features
-   Initial support for architectures supporting the new 16-wide AVX512
    ISA
-   Implemented intersection filter callback support for subdivision
    surfaces
-   Added `RTC_IGNORE_INVALID_RAYS` CMake option which makes the ray
    intersectors more robust against full tree traversal caused by
    invalid ray inputs (e.g. INF, NaN, etc)

### New Features in Embree 2.6.0

-   Added `rtcInterpolate` function to interpolate per vertex
    attributes
-   Added `rtcSetBoundaryMode` function that can be used to select the
    boundary handling for subdivision surfaces
-   Fixed a traversal bug that caused rays with very small ray
    direction components to miss geometry
-   Performance improvements for the robust traversal mode
-   Fixed deadlock when calling `rtcCommit` from multiple
    threads on same scene

### New Features in Embree 2.5.1

-   On dual socket workstations, the initial BVH build performance
    almost doubled through a better memory allocation scheme
-   Reduced memory usage for subdivision surface objects with crease
    features
-   `rtcCommit` performance is robust against unset "flush to zero" and
    "denormals are zero" flags. However, enabling these flags in your
    application is still recommended
-   Reduced memory usage for subdivision surfaces with borders and
    infinitely sharp creases
-   Lots of internal cleanups and bug fixes for both Intel® Xeon® and
    Intel® Xeon Phi™

    surfaces

    set through `rtcSetUserData`
-   Added support for memory monitor callback functions to track and
    limit memory consumption
-   Added support for progress monitor callback functions to track build
    progress and cancel long build operations
-   BVH builders can be used to build user defined hierarchies inside
    the application (see tutorial [BVH Builder])
-   Switched to TBB as default tasking system on Xeon to get even faster
    hierarchy build times and better integration for applications that
    also use TBB
-   `rtcCommit` can get called from multiple TBB threads to join the
    hierarchy build operations

    primitives)

    surfaces
