 * @param data_size_arr - array describing the actual data size used in each stride
 *    The array values define how many bytes of each stride must be sent to
 *    the wire, the remaining bytes in each stride are ignored.
 *    @ref data_size_arr must contain exactly one entry for each stride of the block.
 *    Example:
 *    Entry #0 holds data size of stride #0 of chunk #0
 *    Entry #1 holds data size of stride #1 of chunk #0
 *    Entry #2 holds data size of stride #0 of chunk #1
 *    Entry #3 holds data size of stride #1 of chunk #1
 *    Entry #N holds data size of stride #0 of chunk #M
 *    Entry #N+1 holds data size of stride #1 of chunk #M
 *    Size of the array must be: @ref chunks_num * @ref chunk_size_in_strides.
 *    Note: data size must be <= stride size of the memory block.
 *    Note: last entry/ies of the last chunk in frame/field can be zero.
 *            In this case the remaining strides are ignored (allows to send a sub
 *            chunk at the end of the frame/field).
 *            A chunk cannot start with zeros in its @ref data_size_arr.
 * @param app_hdr_size_arr same as @ref data_size_arr for application headers
 * @param chunks_num - how many chunks fits in this memory block.
 * @param data_mkey - Memory keys representing the packet payload registered memory regions
 *    for each redundant stream in the same order as streams listed in the SDP file.
 *    Ignored if RMAX_OUT_BUFFER_ATTR_DATA_MKEY_IS_SET flag is not set in
 *    buffer attributes.
 * @param app_hdr_mkey - Memory keys representing the application headers
 *    registered memory regions for each redundant stream in the same order as
 *    streams listed in the SDP file. Ignored if
 *    RMAX_OUT_BUFFER_ATTR_APP_HDR_MKEY_IS_SET flag is not set in buffer
 *    attributes.
 *
 * Note:
 *    Rivermax supports two modes of operation:
 *    1. Static setting of data sizes
 *       In this case the data_size_arr is provided at stream creation time and
 *       not changed thereafter. In this case @ref rmax_out_get_next_chunk is used
 *       to obtain chunks.
 *    2. Dynamic setting of data sizes
 *       This is indicated by NOT providing the data_size_arr at stream creation
 *       (i.e. providing a NULL pointer). In this case @ref rmax_out_get_next_chunk_dynamic
 *       is used to obtain both a new chunk and a pointer to a size array - both of which
 *       must be filled before calling @ref rmax_out_commit.
 *
 *    Static or dynamic mode are determined according to whether the
 *    data_size_arr was or wasn't provided at stream creation time.
 *
 *    With respect to the header sizes array:
 *    1. Static setting of data sizes
 *       At stream creation time, if in the containing @ref rmax_buffer_attr
 *       @ref app_hdr_stride_size != 0, @ref app_hdr_size_arr must point to an array of
 *       header sizes. Otherwise it must be NULL.
 *    2. Dynamic setting of data sizes
 *       At stream creation time,
 *       - If in the containing @ref rmax_buffer_attr @ref app_hdr_stride_size != 0:
 *         - @app_hdr_size_arr may point to an array of header sizes, in which
 *           case the header sizes are set for the duration of the stream and
 *           cannot be amended thereafter.
 *         - @app_hdr_size_arr may be NULL, and is obtained together with the
 *           chunk location and @data_size_arr by the call to
 *           @ref rmax_out_get_next_chunk_dynamic. It must be filled before
 *           calling @ref rmax_out_commit.
 *       - If in the containing @ref rmax_buffer_attr @ref app_hdr_stride_size == 0:
 *         A header size array must not be provided at stream creation time

/**
 *  @brief Creates an output stream.
 *
 * This routine creates an output stream with media attributes set by @sdp_chr,
 *  with buffer attributes set by @buffer_attr, QoS attributes set by @qos
 *  and number of packets per frame/field set by @rtp_payload_size .
 * @param sdp_chr - media attributes in SDP format
 *   List of required SDP attributes:
 *     - protocol version, v=, must be set to zero
 *     - Connection Data c= field
 *     - a=fmtp: format, sampling, width, height, exactframerate,
 *        depth, colorimetry, PM, TP
 *     - a=source-filter
 *     -Media name and transport address, m=, "video" must be provided
 *   List of Optional supported SDP parameters and their defaults:
 *     a=fmtp:
 *     interlace: default 0, segmented- default 0, MAXUDP default: 1460
 *     a=group:DUP.
 *     Notice: if DUP exists then the number of identification tags
 *     (tokens following the "DUP" semantic) has to correspond to the number
 *     of m=video blocks.
 *  Example of SDP string:
 *    char *sdp =
 *    "v=0\n"
 *    "m=video 50000 RTP/AVP 112\n"
 *    "c=IN IP4 239.100.9.10/32\n"
 *    "a=source-filter:incl IN IP4 239.100.9.10 192.168.100.7
 *    "a=fmtp:112 sampling=YCbCr-4:2:2; width=1280; height=720;
 *    "exactframerate=60000/1001; depth=10; TCS=SDR; "
 *    "colorimetry=BT709; PM=2110GPM; TP=2110TPN; "
 *    "SSN=ST2110-20:2017; \n";
 * @param buffer_attr - buffer attributes
 * @param qos - QoS attributes.
 * @param num_packets_per_frame - number of packets in a single frame
 * @media_block_index - index of the media block in SDP file (starting at zero)
 *   in order of appearance for which to open an output stream.
 *   Media streams may be grouped by the session-level "a=group" attribute.
 *   note: currently only grouping with the DUP semantic is supported.
 *         In case of DUP video streams, Rivermax creates the duplicate video
 *         stream implicitly and manages the data duplication internally.
 *         From the user's perspective there is always a single output stream.
 *         The index of either of the DUP session's media blocks may be used in
 *         this case (note that each media block, starting at the "m="
 *         directive, has its own index - according to its position within the
 *         SDP file).
 * @stream_id - output argument that returns rmax_stream_id to use for this
