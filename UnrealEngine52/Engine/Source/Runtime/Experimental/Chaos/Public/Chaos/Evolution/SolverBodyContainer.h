	/**
	 * The SolverBodies for a set of particles.
	 * 
	 * Each IslandGroup owns a SolverBodyContainer containing the data required for solving the constraints in the 
	 * group's islands. Constraints will hold pointers to SolverBodies in the Island's SolverBodyContainer.
	 * ConstraintSolvers read and write to their SolverBodies and do not access particles directly.
	 * 
	 * SolverBodies are created at the start of the constraint solving phase, and destroyed at the end. They are
	 * stored in a semi-contiguous (chunked) array in roughly the order that they are accessed for cache efficiency. 
	 * Pointers to SolverBodies are persistent for the duration of the tick, but no longer.
	 * 
	 * @note This container holds all the state of bodies in an island. Dynamics will only appear in one island, 
	 * but kinematics are in multiple and so their state will be duplicated in each island. This is ok - we do 
	 * not write to the state of any kinematic bodies in the constraint solvers. We also assume that the number
	 * of kinematics is small compared to the number of dynamics. If this is commonly untrue we may want to 
	 * consider having a separate (global) container of kinematic solver bodies.
