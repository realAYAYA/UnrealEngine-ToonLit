/**
 * Actor is the base class for an Object that can be placed or spawned in a level.
 * Actors may contain a collection of ActorComponents, which can be used to control how actors move, how they are rendered, etc.
 * The other main function of an Actor is the replication of properties and function calls across the network during play.
 * 
 * 
 * Actor initialization has multiple steps, here's the order of important virtual functions that get called:
 * - UObject::PostLoad: For actors statically placed in a level, the normal UObject PostLoad gets called both in the editor and during gameplay.
 *                      This is not called for newly spawned actors.
 * - UActorComponent::OnComponentCreated: When an actor is spawned in the editor or during gameplay, this gets called for any native components.
 *                                        For blueprint-created components, this gets called during construction for that component.
 *                                        This is not called for components loaded from a level.
 * - AActor::PreRegisterAllComponents: For statically placed actors and spawned actors that have native root components, this gets called now.
 *                                     For blueprint actors without a native root component, these registration functions get called later during construction.
 * - UActorComponent::RegisterComponent: All components are registered in editor and at runtime, this creates their physical/visual representation.
 *                                       These calls may be distributed over multiple frames, but are always after PreRegisterAllComponents.
 *                                       This may also get called later on after an UnregisterComponent call removes it from the world.
 * - AActor::PostRegisterAllComponents: Called for all actors both in the editor and in gameplay, this is the last function that is called in all cases.
 * - AActor::PostActorCreated: When an actor is created in the editor or during gameplay, this gets called right before construction.
 *                             This is not called for components loaded from a level.
 * - AActor::UserConstructionScript: Called for blueprints that implement a construction script.
 * - AActor::OnConstruction: Called at the end of ExecuteConstruction, which calls the blueprint construction script.
 *                           This is called after all blueprint-created components are fully created and registered.
 *                           This is only called during gameplay for spawned actors, and may get rerun in the editor when changing blueprints.
 * - AActor::PreInitializeComponents: Called before InitializeComponent is called on the actor's components.
 *                                    This is only called during gameplay and in certain editor preview windows.
 * - UActorComponent::Activate: This will be called only if the component has bAutoActivate set.
 *                              It will also got called later on if a component is manually activated.
 * - UActorComponent::InitializeComponent: This will be called only if the component has bWantsInitializeComponentSet.
 *                                         This only happens once per gameplay session.
 * - AActor::PostInitializeComponents: Called after the actor's components have been initialized, only during gameplay and some editor previews.
 * - AActor::BeginPlay: Called when the level starts ticking, only during actual gameplay.
 *                      This normally happens right after PostInitializeComponents but can be delayed for networked or child actors.
