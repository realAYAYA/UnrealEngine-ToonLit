	ReplicateMoveToServer() saves the move (in the PendingMove list), calls PerformMovement(), and then replicates the move
	to the server by calling the replicated function ServerMove() - passing the movement parameters, the client's
	resultant position, and a timestamp.
	
	ServerMove() is executed on the server.  It decodes the movement parameters and causes the appropriate movement
	to occur.  It then looks at the resulting position and if enough time has passed since the last response, or the
	position error is significant enough, the server calls ClientAdjustPosition(), a replicated function.
	
	ClientAdjustPosition() is executed on the client.  The client sets its position to the servers version of position,
	and sets the bUpdatePosition flag to true.
	
	When TickComponent() is called on the client again, if bUpdatePosition is true, the client will call
	ClientUpdatePosition() before calling PerformMovement().  ClientUpdatePosition() replays all the moves in the pending
	move list which occurred after the timestamp of the move the server was adjusting.
