	//	then usen 1-N for each subobject in that list. Or it could have 5 arrays using 0-4, and then use 100*ArrayNum + idx for the items in the array.
	//
	//	RepKey should change as the subobject changes. Each time a subobject is marked dirty, its RepKey should change.
	//
	//	GameCode should call ::KeyNeedsToReplicate(ObjID, RepKey) to determine if it needs to replicate. For example:
