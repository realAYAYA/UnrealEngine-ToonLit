* Stencil layout during basepass / deferred decals:
*		BIT ID    | USE
*		[0]       | sandbox bit (bit to be use by any rendering passes, but must be properly reset to 0 after using)
*		[1]       | unallocated
*		[2]       | Distance Field Representation
*		[3]       | Temporal AA mask for translucent object.
*		[4]       | Lighting channels
*		[5]       | Lighting channels
*		[6]       | Lighting channels
*		[7]       | primitive receive decal bit
*
* After deferred decals, stencil is cleared to 0 and no longer packed in this way, to ensure use of fast hardware clears and HiStencil.
