/**
 * Packet Auditing
 *
 * Description:
 *	This implements a means of verifying the correct serialization of packets between a client and server,
 *	and is primarily for use during development of the netcode (particularly with the PacketHandler).
 *
 *	If used liberally, it should quickly zoom in on the precise location of packet serialization problems,
 *	greatly reducing time spent debugging, and - critically - avoiding having to manually reverse engineer packet dumps.
 *
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *	In code where you are writing data for sending, you can mark a stage of packet writing for auditing, like so:
 *		FPacketAudit::AddStage(TEXT("UniqueName"), OutPacket);
 *
 *	In code where you are reading incoming packet data, you can implement auditing for that stage as so:
 *		FPacketAudit::CheckStage(TEXT("UniqueName"), InPacket);
 *
 *	Replace 'UniqueName', with a descriptive and unique name, for marking the stage of serialization being checked.
 *	OutPacket must refer to an FBitWriter, and InPacket must refer to an FBitReader.
 *
 *	Run the client/server with '-PacketAudit' added to the commandline.
 *
 *
 * Notes/Limitations:
 *	- It's safe to leave AddStage/CheckStage in the netcode, without wrapping them in #if blocks, as they're compiled-out in shipping
 *	- You need to run the server/client as administrator
 *	- Only a single client and server can perform packet auditing at any given time.
 *	- Does not function well with ReliabilityHandlerComponent or packetloss.
 *	- Auditing assumes simple bit reader/writer serialization, and may choke when used with more complex packet parsing
 *	- Every call to AddStage, must have a corresponding call to CheckStage - or packet data will leak and eventually cause an assert
 *
 *
 * Technicals:
 *	The auditing code uses Inter-Process-Communication, by means of shared memory and a mutex for guarding access,
 *	to serialize two TMap's containing packet auditing data, into binary format, and passes them between the client/server processes.
