/**
 * Net Analytics Aggregation
 *
 * Net analytics aggregation is used by the NetDriver (and primarily Oodle), to collect analytics during the lifetime of the NetDriver,
 * and to aggregate it so that it can be dispatched in one consolidated analytics event, at the end of the NetDriver's lifetime.
 *
 * This is useful for e.g. per-NetConnection analytics data, which we want to acquire but don't want to spam the analytics service with,
 * so we need an interface to aggregate at the NetDriver level (in principle, this should be reusable outside of the netcode too).
 *
 *
 * Usage:
 * To collect analytics data you will need to subclass FNetAnalyticsData and use the REGISTER_NET_ANALYTICS macro,
 * to create and register an instance of your data holder, with a NetDriver's NetAnalyticsAggregator,
 * using a unique name that only your code uses (preferably the analytics event name).
 *
 * This will also need to be registered in *Engine.ini, for each NetDriverName, e.g.:
 *	[GameNetDriver NetAnalyticsAggregatorConfig]
 *	+NetAnalyticsData=(DataName="Core.ServerNetConn", bEnabled=true)
 *
 * Then assign the result of REGISTER_NET_ANALYTICS, to store a reference to your data holder, in the location you collect analytics.
 *
 * The way your FNetAnalyticsData subclass collects and stores/aggregates data is up to you (and so is the thread-safety for that data),
 * just implement SendAnalytics to process and dispatch all of the aggregated data upon NetDriver shutdown. It's only called once.
 *
 *
 * Multithreaded lifetime:
 * All multithreaded analytics aggregation objects/data/events must be complete by NetDriver shut down.
 * Staying within the normal course of netcode send/receive paths should achieve this.
