	//! TODO: We should add in a way for NetDrivers to opt out of PushModel.
	//! Things like the Beacon Net Driver, for example, don't need to care about it.

	/**
	 * Class that is used to manage Push Model Object states by using Custom IDs.
	 *
	 * This class relies on every Replicated UObject to have a Push Model Controlled ID
	 * associated with it. This ID is injected into the Base Most Replicated class
	 * during header generation.
	 *
	 * For example, UObject does not have the ID field added, but UActorComponent does.
	 * Since USceneComponent derives from UActorComponent, it can just use the injected
	 * ID from UActorComponent.
	 *
	 * Currently, this works fine for BP because you can't directly derive BPs from UObjects.
	 * They need to be either AActor or UActorComponent, and those will have the injected IDs.
	 * If that changes, we may need to move the custom IDs to base UObject and eat the memory.
	 *
	 * Also, instead of tracking Objects by pointer, we need another ID that can be used to track
	 * objects **outside** of networking contexts. We opt for FObjectKey. Although they are
	 * somewhat expensive to construct, they ensure uniqueness and ensure that the reference
	 * to a given object will be unique even across garbage collections if we're given stale
	 * pointers.
	 *
	 * **********************************************************************************
	 * ************* Adding Objects to and Remove Objects From the Manager **************
	 * **********************************************************************************
	 *
	 * Objects are lazily added to the manager (this will be true of any manager).
	 * Currently, this is tied directly to FRepChangelistState.
	 * Whenever a FRepChangelistState is created, we will call AddPushModelObject
	 * and whenever a FRepChangelistState is destroyed, we will call RemovePushModelObject.
	 *
	 * FRepChangelistState are only created once on a NetDriver for a given Object in game,
	 * and are then shared across all connections.
	 *
	 * This also means that multiple Net Drivers can "Add" or "Remove" push model objects.
	 *
	 * To cope with this, there will is one global FPushModelPerObjectState that is alive
	 * as long as **any** Net Drivers are replicating the object. There will also be one
	 * FPushModelPerNetDriverState alive for each individual Net Driver that is replicating
	 * an object.
	 *
	 * **********************************************************************************
	 * ****************************** Managing Dirty State ******************************
	 * **********************************************************************************
	 *
	 * When an Object is marked dirty from "Game Land", user's will pass a Object's
	 * Push Model ID as well as the Rep Index for the property (or properties). These
	 * things can mostly be determined at compile time using the MARK_PROPERTY_DIRTY_* macros,
	 * meaning that users only really need to pass the Property's Owning Class, the Property's
	 * name, and an Object Pointer.
	 *
	 * If the object is not currently replicated by any net drivers, its Push Model ID will be
	 * INDEX_NONE, and we will ignore it. Otherwise, we will set the necessary dirty bit
	 * on the FPushModelPerObjectState.
	 *
	 * That dirty state will remain set until we go to replicate the object.
	 *
	 * **********************************************************************************
	 * ************************* Replication using Dirty State **************************
	 * **********************************************************************************
	 *
	 * When a given Net Driver goes to Compare an Object's properties for replication,
	 * it will request the Push Model State (GetPerNetDriverState). At that point, we will
	 * push the Global Dirty State (on FPushModelPerObjectState) to the Per Net Driver
	 * Dirty States (on FPushModelPerNetDriverState). In this case, "Pushing State" is
	 * effectively a bitwise or of the Push Model Dirty States into the
	 * Per Net Driver Dirty State, and then clearing the Global Dirty State.
	 *
	 * There were 2 main reasons why this was done lazily:
	 *	1. The subset of Actors that we *will* replicate is always going to be much much
	 *		smaller than the total number of Actors that *may* replicate.
	 *
	 *	2. There isn't a good catch all spot to do this.
	 *		- Originally having the NetDriver's call this before replication occurred
	 *			was tested, but properties can be changed during AActor::PreReplication.
	 *			Further, because Reliable RPCs can force new Channel's open, and initial
	 *			replication, extra steps had to be taken to try and update states there
	 *			as well.
	 *
	 *		- Using AActor::CalPreReplication was also considered. However, there's
	 *			currently no good interface for getting all replicated subobjects of an
	 *			Actor (or other subobjects), so there's no guarantee we'd push states.
	 *			Additionally, even if there was an interface this wouldn't necessarily
	 *			respect Subobject Replication Keys.
	 *
	 * Doing this lazily is a simple solution to both of these problems, with the trade
	 * off that if multiple NetDrivers are replicating on the same frame, we may try to
	 * push the state multiple times. But, we can detect that no properties have changed
	 * since the last push, and not waste much time.
	 *
	 * When a property is *not* marked dirty but is Push Enabled, then we will skip comparing it.
	 * When a property is marked dirty, or is not Push Enabled, we will compare it.
	 * See the comments in PushModel.h for more info on that.
	 *
	 * **********************************************************************************
	 * ******************* Potential for "Automatic Subobject Keys" *********************
	 * **********************************************************************************
	 *
	 * Push Model could achieve the same effect as Subobject Keys without requiring users
	 * to do any extra work or manage additional state themselves.
	 *
	 * When an Object is about to be replicated (see FObjectReplicator::ReplicateProperties)
	 * we could check to see if all the Object's properties were Push Model based.
	 *
	 * If they were, we could efficiently check to see whether or not *any* properties had changed.
	 *
	 * If they hadn't, we could skip doing any additional work for standard properties.
	 * Some work may still need to happen for Custom Delta Properties (Fast Arrays).
	 *
	 * **********************************************************************************
	 * ********************** Potential for "Automatic Dormancy" ************************
	 * **********************************************************************************
	 *
	 * Push model may support the notion of Automatic Dormancy in the future. The premise
	 * being that instead of relying on designers or developers to to call FlushNetDormancy
	 * when changing object properties, instead Push Model could be used as a drop in
	 * substitute. If you're already adhering to the contract of Push Model, your system
	 * will already have all the necessary hooks to determine when properties change.
	 *
	 * This comes with a few nice benefits:
	 *	1. It would be impossible to forget to wake an Actor up when properties change.
	 *
	 *	2. Similarly, if you Components / Subobjects that contained shared logic,
	 *		there would be no extra special casing to mark the owning Actor awake.
	 *
	 *	3. **Every** type of object that fully relied on Push Model could automatically
	 *		make use of this system without the need for extra configuration.
	 *		This is especially useful considering all Blueprints derived directly from
	 *		AActor, UActorComponent, and USceneComponent would currently be in this
	 *		category. The more engine conversion that happens, the broader that becomes.
	 *
	 * Speculative plan for how this might work:
	 *
	 *	1. The fundamental machinery of Dormancy stays the same.
	 *		An Object is eligible for Dormancy if none of it's properties have changed
	 *		for some configurable timeout, and all connections have received its most
	 *		up to date information.
	 *
	 *	2. Alongside dirty property states, Push Model could also have a bitfield that
	 *		tracks whether or not an object was dirtied in a frame. Alternatively,
	 *		that state could be derived from FPushModelPerObjectState.
	 *
	 *	3. At some defined point in a frame before Replication of any NetDrivers
	 *		occurs, we push the Dirty Object State to the Net Driver.
	 *		This might work by just having each Net Driver grab the Dirty Object
	 *		bitfield and if a given object is dirty, mapping the Object ID back
	 *		to Actor / Object, and then calling the normal Flush Net Dormancy calls.
	 *
	 *	4. At some defined point in a frame *after* Replication of *every* NetDriver,
	 *		we reset the Object Dirty State.
	 *
	 * The trickiest part of this would likely be finding an efficient mapping back from a
	 * PushModel ID to a Networked Object. Push Model was designed to be mostly agnostic
	 * to Objects and because of that explicitly doesn't provide any API to go from a
	 * Push ID back to an Object.
