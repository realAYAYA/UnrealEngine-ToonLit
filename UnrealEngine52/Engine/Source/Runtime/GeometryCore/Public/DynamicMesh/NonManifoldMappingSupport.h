/*
* The FNonManifoldMappingSupport is a light-weight class that exists to interpret and manage additional DynamicMesh data stored 
* when the mesh was created from a potentially non-manifold source mesh.  
*
* For context the FDynamicMesh3 is less accepting of non-manifold mesh features than some source mesh data-structures
* and conversion to a DynamicMesh may require changes to the topology ( e.g. vertex splits)  and in such cases
* this class can be use to access the mapping from DynamicMesh vertices to the source mesh vertices that generated them.
* 
* Note:
* Since this class holds pointers to named attributes owned by the DynamicMesh, unintended behavior will result if said attributes
* are removed from the mesh while an associated NomManifoldSupport object is in use. 
*
* Also, any mapping information between the DynamicMesh and source data will be corrupted by topological changes 
* to the DynamicMesh (e.g. edge splits, collapses etc).
