/**
 * FMeshTriEdgeID identifies an edge in a triangle mesh based on 
 * the triangle ID/Index and the "edge index" 0/1/2 in the triangle.
 * If the ordered triangle vertices are [A,B,C], then [A,B]=0, [B,C]=1, and [C,A]=2.
 * 
 * This type of edge identifier is applicable on any indexed mesh, even if 
 * the mesh does not store explicit edge IDs. 
 * 
 * Values are stored unsigned, so it is currently *not* possible to store an "invalid"
 * edge identifier as a FMeshTriEdgeID (0xFFFFFFFF could potentially be used as such an identifier).
 * 
 * The TriangleID is stored in 30 bits, while FDynamicMesh3 stores (valid) triangle IDs in 31 bits.
 * So, only ~1 billion triangles are allowed in a mesh when using FMeshTriEdgeID, vs ~2 billion in FDynamicMesh3.
 * This limit has not been encountered in practice, to date.
 * 
 * Note that cycling or permuting the vertices of a triangle will change these indices.

 * So the ordered edge in the triangle can be represented as two vertex indices, 
 * and the full encoding is (TriangleID, J, K) where J and K are in range 0/1/2.
 * 
 * This type of edge identifier is applicable on any indexed mesh, even if 
 * the mesh does not store explicit edge IDs. In addition, this identifier is stable
 * across mesh topological changes, ie if two connected triangles are unlinked (ie
 * the shared edge becomes two edges, and the 2 vertices become 4), the FMeshTriOrderedEdgeID
 * will still refer to the correct oriented edge, as it does not explicitly depend on
 * the Vertex or Edge IDs, only the ordering within the triangle.
 *
