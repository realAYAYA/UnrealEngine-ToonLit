	 * Compute an approximate Poisson sampling of the mesh, either uniform or non-uniform depending on the settings above.
	 * The sampling will attempt to fully cover the mesh unless .MaxSamples is provided, in which case exactly
	 * that many samples will be generated and they will be randomly distributed (so not at all Poisson...!)
	 * 
	 * By default the sampling will be uniform - all points will be spaced at least .SampleRadius*2, ie no "collisions"
	 * between their bounding spheres.
	 * 
	 * If .MaxSampleRadius is larger than .SampleRadius, the sampling will be non-uniform, ie samples will be emitted
	 * with radii within this range. By default a random uniform distribution of radii will be attempted, .SizeDistribution 
	 * and related parameters can be used to make this distribution non-uniform. 
	 * The spacing between points will always be greater than the sum of their two sample radii, so again no collisions. 
	 * However the "density" of the sampling will vary depending on how well the algorithm can find gaps to fill.
	 * 
	 * If .bUseVertexWeights is defined and valid VertexWeights are provided, they will be used to modulate the sampling radii.
	 * The .InterpretWeightMode setting controls how the weights are used to influence the sample radii.
	 * 
	 * The strategy used is to compute a much higher density sampling than needed (based on .SubSampleDensity),
	 * then iteratively select from that point set and decimate it within the radius of selected samples. The implementation
	 * also introduces various biases to increase performance. Generally increasing SubSampleDensity will result in 
	 * more tightly-packed results, but at increasingly expensive computation time.
