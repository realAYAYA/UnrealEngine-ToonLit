/**
 * Interface for the Media module.
 *
 * Media Framework is ticked in several stages. The Input tick happens after the Engine
 * (including Sequencer, game world, and Blueprints) were ticked. This allows any game
 * logic to modify the state of tickable media objects before they fetch input.
 *
 * The Update tick happens right after the Input tick when all tickable media objects
 * have fetched the latest input based on their current state.
 *
 * Finally, the Output tick happens after all game and core ticking completed, and
 * after all render commands have been enqueued. It is the very last thing to happen
 * before the frame is complete.
