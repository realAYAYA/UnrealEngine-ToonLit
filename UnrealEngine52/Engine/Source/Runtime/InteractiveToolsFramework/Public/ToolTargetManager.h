// TODO: Do we need more control over factory order to prioritize which gets used if we can
// make multiple qualifying targets? It should theoretically not matter, but in practice, one
// target or another could be more efficient for certain tasks. This is probably only worth
// thinking about once we encounter it.

// NOTE FOR IMPLEMENTING CACHING: Someday we will probably write a tool target manager that
// caches tool targets and gives prebuilt ones when possible to avoid any extra conversions.
// When implementing this, note that currently, some targets store converted versions of their
// source objects without a way to determine whether their stored conversion is out of date.
// The cached target will then give an incorrect result if the source object has been
// modified after caching.
// One way to deal with this is to have subclasses of UToolTarget that give the degree of
// cacheability- fully cacheable (i.e., detects changes and rebuilds if necessary), cacheable
// only if changes are made through that tool target (i.e. target manager has to clear it if
// object may have changed; may choose not to have this option), or not cacheable. 

/**
 * The tool target manager converts input objects into tool targets- objects that
 * can expose various interfaces that tools need to operate on them.
 *
 * Someday, the tool target manager may implement caching of targets.
 * 
 * See the class comment for UToolTarget for more info.
