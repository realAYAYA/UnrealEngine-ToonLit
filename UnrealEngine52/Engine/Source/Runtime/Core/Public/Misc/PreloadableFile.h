/**
 * A read-only archive that adds support for asynchronous preloading and priming to an inner archive.
 *
 * This class supports two mutually-exclusive modes:
 *   PreloadBytes:
 *     An asynchronous inner archive is opened using the passed-in CreateAsyncArchive function; this call is made asynchronously on a TaskGraph thread.
 *     The size is read during initialization.
 *     After initialization, when StartPreload is called, an array of bytes equal in size to the inner archive's size is allocated,
 *       and an asynchronous ReadRequest is sent to the IAsyncReadFileHandle to read the first <PageSize> bytes of the file.
 *     Upon completion of each in-flight ReadRequest, another asynchronous ReadRequest is issued, until the entire file has been read.
 *     If serialize functions are called beyond the bytes of the file that have been cached so far, they requests are satisfied by synchronous reads.
 *
 *     Activate this mode by passing an FCreateArchive to InitializeAsync.
 *  PreloadHandle:
 *     A synchronous inner archive is opened using the passed-in CreateArchive function; this call is made asynchronously on a TaskGraph thread.
 *     Optionally, a precache request is sent to the inner archive for the first <PrimeSize> bytes; this call is also made asynchronously.
 *     The created and primed lower-level FArchive can then be detached from this class and handed off to a new owner.
 *
 *    Activate this mode by passing an FCreateAsyncArchive and (optionally, for the precache request) Flags::Prime to InitializeAsync.
 *
 * This class is not threadsafe. The public interface can be used at the same time as internal asynchronous tasks are executing, but the
 * public interface can not be used from multiple threads at once.
