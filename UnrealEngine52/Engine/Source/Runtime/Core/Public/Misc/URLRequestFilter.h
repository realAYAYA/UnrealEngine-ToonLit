/**
 * A filter that can used to restrict URL schemes and domains to known-safe values.
 * Stores a map of schemes to domains: if the map is empty, no filtering is performed and any URL is allowed.
 * Each key is a scheme (such as "https"). If a scheme is present, it will be allowed.
 * Each value is an array of absolute domains or partial higher-level domains that are allowed for their scheme.
 *
 * Absolute domains do not start with a period and will be matched exactly with domains from the input URL,
 * for example, "epicgames.com".
 *
 * Partial domains start with a period and will be matched with the ending of the input domain.
 * Use these to allow all subdomains of the higher-level domain. For example, ".epicgames.com"
 *
 * To allow both an absolute domain and all of its subdomains, provide two entries in the array,
 * one with the period prefix and one without. For example, "epicgames.com" and ".epicgames.com".
