/**
 *  Base class for blueprint based decorator nodes. Do NOT use it for creating native c++ classes!
 *
 *  Unlike task and services, decorator have two execution chains: 
 *   ExecutionStart-ExecutionFinish and ObserverActivated-ObserverDeactivated
 *  which makes automatic latent action cleanup impossible. Keep in mind, that
 *  you HAVE TO verify is given chain is still active after resuming from any
 *  latent action (like Delay, Timelines, etc).
 *
 *  Helper functions:
 *  - IsDecoratorExecutionActive (true after ExecutionStart, until ExecutionFinish)
 *  - IsDecoratorObserverActive (true after ObserverActivated, until ObserverDeactivated)
