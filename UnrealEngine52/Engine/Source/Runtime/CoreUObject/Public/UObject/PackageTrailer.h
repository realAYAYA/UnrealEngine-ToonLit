/** Trailer Format
 * The FPackageTrailer is a container that will commonly be appended to the end of a package file. The main purpose of the trailer is to store
 * the bulkdata payloads contained by the package until they are virtualized or moved to an additional storage location.
 * 
 * By storing the payloads in a data format adjacent to the rest of the package we can perform the virtualization process without needing to 
 * re-save the package itself which in turn should allow for external tools to be able to perform the virtualization process themselves
 * rather than needing to force it through engine code.
 * 
 * The package trailer is intended to an easy format for external code/script to be able to manipulate. To make things clearer we do not 
 * serialize containers directly but write out each data structure one at a time so that it should be easy to see how to manipulate the file.
 * 
 * The file is split into three parts:
 * 
 * [Header]
 * The header contains the useful info about the trailer and the payloads in general. @See UE::FLookupTableEntry for details about 
 * the look up table's data.
 * 
 * [Payload Data]
 * If the trailer is in the workspace domain package then we will store all non-virtualized payloads here. If the trailer is in the editor 
 * domain then there will be no payload data section and the header will be referencing the trailer in the workspace domain instead.
 * 
 * [Footer]
 * The footer allows for us to load the trailer in reverse and replicates the end of package file tag (PACKAGE_FILE_TAG), it should only be
 * used for finding the start of the trailer or validation.
 * 
 * CurrentVersion UE::EPackageTrailerVersion::INITIAL
 * ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 * | [Header]																																	|
 * | Tag				| uint64			| Should match FHeader::HeaderTag, used to identify that the data being read is an FPackageTrailer	|
 * | Version			| uint32			| Version number of the format@see UE::EPackageTrailerVersion										|
 * | HeaderLength		| uint32			| The total size of the header on disk in bytes.													|
 * | PayloadsDataLength	| uint64			| The total size of the payload data on disk in bytes												|
 * | NumPayloads		| int32				| The number of payloads in LookupTableArray														|
 * | LookupTableArray	| FLookupTableEntry | An array of FLookupTableEntry @see UE::Private::FLookupTableEntry									|

 * | [Payload Data]																																|
 * | Array				| FCompressedBuffer | A binary blob containing all of the payloads. Individual payloads can be found via				|
 * |										 the LookupTableArray found in the header.															|
 * |____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________|
 * | [Footer]																																	|

 * | TrailerLength		| uint64			| The total size of the trailer on disk in bytes. Can be used to find the start of the trailer when	|
 * |										  reading backwards.																				|
 * | PackageTag			| uint32			| The end of package tag, PACKAGE_FILE_TAG. This is used to validate that a package file on disk is	|
 * |										  not corrupt. By ending the trailer with this tag we allow that validation code to work.			|
