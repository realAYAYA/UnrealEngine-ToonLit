 * The goal of this class is to provide an editor time version of BulkData that will work with the asset
 * virtualization system.
 *
 * Assuming that the DDC is hot, the virtualized payloads are accessed relatively infrequently, usually when the package
 * is being edited in the editor in some manner. So the payload access is designed around this. If the data is frequently 
 * accessed when running the editor then the user would not gain from having it virtualized as they would end up pulling
 * it immediately anyway.
 *
 * The biggest difference with normal bulkdata is that the access times might be significantly longer if the
 * payload is not readily available which is why the only way to access the payload is by a TFuture or a callback
 * so that the caller is forced to consider how to handle the potential stall and hopefully organize their code 
 * in such a way that the time lag is not noticeable to the user.
 *
 * The second biggest difference is that the caller will own the payload memory once it is returned to them, unlike
 * the old bulkdata class which would retain ownership. Which forces the calling code to be in control of when the 
 * memory is actually allocated and for how long. With the old bulkdata class a single access would leave that memory
 * allocated in a non-obvious way and would lead to memory bloats within the editor.
 *
 * The method ::GetGuid can be used to access a unique identifier for the payload, currently it is based on the 
 * payload itself, so that two objects with the same payload would both have the same Guid. The intent is that we 
 * would be able to share local copies of the payload between branches to reduce the cost of having multiple branches 
 * with similar data on the same machine.
