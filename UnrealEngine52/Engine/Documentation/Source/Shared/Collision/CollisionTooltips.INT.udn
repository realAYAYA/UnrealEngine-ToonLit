[EXCERPT:ObjectChannel]

Object Channel is the collision channel type that can be assigned to object as Object Type. 

![](ObjectType.png)

This used to be [Movement Channel] because it is used when this object is moved. 

When you define collision property for object, you define 3 set ups.

- Collision Enabled : Is there any collision? If there is collision, do you want this object to be simulated?
- Object Type : Define what object type this will use when it is being moved
- Collision Response : Response to other objects

This is a lot of information to set up, so we implemented [Collision Presets] as the one you can quickly choose and set.

If you would like to assign to object, you want this channel to be [Object Channel]

Query functions also allow trace [Object Type]. For example, you can query finding all objects within this sphere when the Object Type is Pawn.

[EXCERPT:TraceChannel]

We distinguish Trace Channel vs Object Channel for major two reasons. 

Object Channel is the one that can be assigned to object as Object Type and can be queried by Object Type when traced. Please check the above Object Channel tooltip. 
Trace Channel is when you have a specific purpose of trace, for example, Weapon Trace. Even though it is possible to create bullet object that has object type as "Weapon", often most of games do direct ray cast to the target. When you trace using "Weapon" Trace type, each object can decide how you would like to respond to it. 

Another example is camera. You can decide to have camera object to contain their Object Type to be Camera, in which case Camera is Object Channel. 
But also you can choose to use Camera as Trace Channel, and use it in your trace code to trace using that channel, and other objects can decide how they would like to respond. 

The distinction is shown in below when using same functionality.

This two works slightly different. 

First version is trace by Channel, which specifies Trace Channel. 
This will trace from Start to End with sphere of radius 30, and will find anything that RESPONDS to Weapon Trace. 

This respond is defined per object.

Second version is trace by Object. 
This will trace from Start to End with sphere of radius 30, and will find anything that has Object Type to be Pawn OR PhysicsObject.

[EXCERPT:Preset]
We provide presets of collision settings for components to use. 

![](CollisionPreset.png)

If you modify this, note that it can change an existing object's behavior. 
Please be careful when you modify these values. If you would like to modify this, please go to Project Settings/Collision.

You can also add your presets and assign them to components. 

You need to save this to default config otherwise your change will not show to other users.
