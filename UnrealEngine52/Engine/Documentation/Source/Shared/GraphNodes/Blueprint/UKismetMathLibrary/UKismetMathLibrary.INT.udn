[EXCERPT:FInterpTo]


The "FInterp to" (float interpolation) node allows you to smoothly transition a float value to a different target value. When utilized, this node will take your current float value and (based on a time-step and speed) output a new float approaching (or equal to) the target value.

NOTE: That the output value should be used as the "Current" input for the following frame. If the input value sits unchanged, then this node will make the same step each frame (resulting in the same output every time, failing to ever reach the "Target" value). If a Speed of 0 is given, then the result will be the target. 


---

**Input**

Current - Takes a current float value for this node to interpolate from. 
Target - Takes a float value for this node to interpolate to. 
Delta Time - Takes in a float time-step value used to move forward the interpolation. 
Interp Speed - Takes in a float value used to indicate how fast the interpolation should step to the Target value. 

---

**Output**

Return Value - This outputs an interpolated float value approaching (or equal to) the Target value.

[EXCERPT:RInterpTo]


The "RInterp to" (Rotator interpolation) node allows you to smoothly transition from one Rotator to another. When utilized, this node will take your current Rotator and (based on a time-step and speed) output a new Rotator approaching (or equal to) the target one.

NOTE: That the output value should be used as the "Current" input for the following frame. If the input value sits unchanged, then this node will make the same step each frame (resulting in the same output every time, failing to ever reach the "Target" value). If a Speed of 0 is given, then the result will be the target.

NOTE: That the output value should be used as the "Current" input for the following frame. If the input value sits unchanged, then this node will make the same step each frame (resulting in the same output every time, failing to ever reach the "Target" value). If a Speed of 0 is given, then the result will be the target.

If the input value sits unchanged, then this node will make the same step each frame (resulting in the same output every time, failing to ever reach the "Target" value). If a Speed of 0 is given, then the result will be the target.  If a Speed of 0 is given, then the result will be the target.
