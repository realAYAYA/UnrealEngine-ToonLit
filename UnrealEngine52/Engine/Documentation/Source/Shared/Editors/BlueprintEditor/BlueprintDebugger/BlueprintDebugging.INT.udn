Description:Overview of Blueprint Debugging.


[EXCERPT:DebugObject]

The debugging object specifies which instance of your Blueprint in the level the debugger should monitor for events.  You can set this to a particular instance of a Blueprint in your level, or you can leave it unspecified, and the first instance that triggers a breakpoint will automatically be selected as the instance being debugged.
