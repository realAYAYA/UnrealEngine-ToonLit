[EXCERPT:WalkableSlopeBehavior]

Determines how the Walkable Slope Angle operates on the existing walkable angle, whether it increases or decreases it.

[EXCERPT:WalkableSlopeAngle]

The value which operates on the existing walkable angle, modifying it by the method set by the Walkable Slope Behaviour.
If increasing walkable slope, this can only increase walkability, never restricting the character to lower slopes than usual.
If decreasing walkable slope, this can only decrease walkability, never enabling the character to traverse steeper slopes than usual.
