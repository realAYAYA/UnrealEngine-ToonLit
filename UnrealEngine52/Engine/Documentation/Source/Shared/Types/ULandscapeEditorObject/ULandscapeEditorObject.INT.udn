[EXCERPT:ManageMode]
Manage Mode contains tools that will allow you to add a new Landscape, import/export a Landscape, add/remove Landscape components and manage Landscape streaming. Mange mode will also allow you to select individual landscape components and modify their properties in the level editor's details panel.

[EXCERPT:NewLandscape_QuadsPerSection]
Section size is used for Landscape LOD and Culling. Smaller sections allow the Landscape to LOD sections more aggressively but with will have a higher CPU cost. Larger sizes will allow for fewer components and will be less costly on the CPU. If you want to have a large Landscape you will need to use a larger section size as using a smaller section size and scaling the Landscape up could cost too much on the CPU.

[EXCERPT:NewLandscape_SectionsPerComponent]
Sections Per Component helps with the Landscapes LOD.  Each section is the basic unit for the Landscape LOD. One component could have 2 x 2 sections which mean�s that is possible that one component could be rendering four different LOD�s at once. With a larger section size you get the added benefit of reduced CPU calculation time. However you could run into issues with the Landscape rendering to many vertices at once. This is could be especially prevalent when using very large areas of Landscape.  These problems could be even worse on mobile devices because of the limited amount of draw calls you can have due to hardware limitations.

[EXCERPT:NewLandscape_ComponentCount]
Along with section size, this sets the size of your landscape. This value is capped at 32 x 32 because each component does have a CPU cost associated with it and going over this cap could result in performance issues with the Landscape.

[EXCERPT:bUseClayBrush]
The Clay Brush works by looking at the average direction of all of the faces that are under the mouse and then moving the vertices in the averaged direction. Because of this the Clay Brush is very good at filling in gaps and creating holes in the Landscape.
