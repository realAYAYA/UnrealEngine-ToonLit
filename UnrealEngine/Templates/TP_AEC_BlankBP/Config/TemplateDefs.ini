; This file specifies how a template will be treated when creating a project from it.
; It includes rules for ignoring files, replacing files and changing the contents of files.
; This file is annotated to help with creating your own templates.

; The sort key to use for the template to bypass the default alphabetical sorting.

; This project uses a thumbnail as the project icon
bThumbnailAsIcon=true

; A list of folders to avoid copying when creating a project from this template. 
; These should contain files only of concern to the template itself and not desired in the user's project.
FoldersToIgnore=Media

; The files to ignore copying, relative to the template root folder. 
; %TEMPLATENAME% will be replaced by the template's folder name when resolving these. 
; Filename comparisons are case-insensitive. 
; For example, if this template is "TP_Blank" and the user creates "MyProject", then "TP_Blank.uproject" will be copied to "MyProject.uproject".
FilesToIgnore="%TEMPLATENAME%.uproject"
FilesToIgnore="%TEMPLATENAME%.png"
FilesToIgnore="Config/TemplateDefs.ini"
FilesToIgnore="Manifest.json"
FilesToIgnore="contents.txt"

; NOTE: For the purposes of the below examples, this template is considered to be named "TP_Blank", and the user has created a project called "MyProject".

; Folders that will be renamed when creating a project from this template.
; %PROJECTNAME% will be replaced by the project name specified by the user during creation when resolving these rules.
; For example,  then "Source/TP_Blank" will be copied to "Source/MyProject".
FolderRenames=(From="Source/%TEMPLATENAME%", To="Source/%PROJECTNAME%")
FolderRenames=(From="Source/%TEMPLATENAME%Editor", To="Source/%PROJECTNAME%Editor")

; Rules for renaming files when creating a project from this template. 
; %TEMPLATENAME_UPPERCASE% and %PROJECTNAME_UPPERCASE% are the template and project names in upper case, eg. for "TP_Blank", its upper case representation is "TP_BLANK".
; %TEMPLATENAME_LOWERCASE% and %PROJECTNAME_LOWERCASE% are the template and project names in lower case, eg. for "TP_Blank", its lower case representation is "tp_blank".
; A rule does not have to include any of these modifiers. 
; Extensions is a list of files to consider for these replacements. Eg. ("cpp", "h") will try to apply a rule only to files like "SomeFile.cpp" and "SomeFile.h".
; bCaseSensitive specifies whether this replacement should be case-sensitive.

; Here are some default rules for renaming files:

; This rule states that a file called "TP_BLANK.cpp" will be renamed to "MYPROJECT.cpp".
FilenameReplacements=(Extensions=("cpp","h","ini","cs"), From="%TEMPLATENAME_UPPERCASE%", To="%PROJECTNAME_UPPERCASE%", bCaseSensitive=true)

; This rule states that a file called "tp_blank.ini" will be renamed to "myproject.ini"
FilenameReplacements=(Extensions=("cpp","h","ini","cs"), From="%TEMPLATENAME_LOWERCASE%", To="%PROJECTNAME_LOWERCASE%", bCaseSensitive=true)

; And this rule catches any irregularly-cased files, so that "Tp_bLANK.ini" will be renamed to "MyProject.ini".
FilenameReplacements=(Extensions=("cpp","h","ini","cs"), From="%TEMPLATENAME%",To="%PROJECTNAME%",bCaseSensitive=false)

; Rules for renaming strings in the contents of files. 
; The same rules as above apply, but any usages of strings that match these rules inside the file will be changed. This includes all substrings!
; For example, "TP_Blank" will be replaced by "MyProject", but "TP_Blank_Name" will also be replaced by "MyProject_Name".
ReplacementsInFiles=(Extensions=("cpp","h","ini","cs"), From="%TEMPLATENAME_UPPERCASE%", To="%PROJECTNAME_UPPERCASE%", bCaseSensitive=true)
ReplacementsInFiles=(Extensions=("cpp","h","ini","cs"), From="%TEMPLATENAME_LOWERCASE%", To="%PROJECTNAME_LOWERCASE%", bCaseSensitive=true)
ReplacementsInFiles=(Extensions=("cpp","h","ini","cs"), From="%TEMPLATENAME%", To="%PROJECTNAME%", bCaseSensitive=false)

; The following settings are not enabled for this project, but are included for completeness:
