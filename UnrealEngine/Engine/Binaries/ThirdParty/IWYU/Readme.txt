Include-what-you-use (IWYU)

The binary in this folder is a special version of IWYU that contains lots of modifications to be able to run iwyu on Unreal code base without too much touch-up needed.
IWYU is used through the UnrealBuildTool iwyu mode (Open IWYUMode.cs to read more).

The source code for this version of IWYU is found at https://github.com/EpicGames/include-what-you-use
