Dart files in this directory are not directly included in the app's source -- instead, they will be
processed by Pigeon to generate code that facilitates communication between Flutter and each of
the platform languages.

You can modify the files in this directory to change the cross-platform API. Each file has an
"@ConfigurePigeon" annotation which specifies where the resulting generated files will be stored
for each target language. These generated files *should* be checked into Perforce, as they are not
automatically generated each time the app is run.

To re-generate Pigeon output, run this in your terminal from the app's root directory:

  dart run pigeon --input pigeons/<filename>.dart
