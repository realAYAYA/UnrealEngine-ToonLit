# ArtToolsOSX_UnrealEngine


A port of the Unreal Engine Animation & Rigging Toolkit to OS X

All work copyright Jeremy Ernst and Epic Games and all other respective owners.

The things that won't work: 

You can't have a background image for the UI with the code that was used to construct the UI. This is due to an indexing difference between OS X Maya and Windows Maya. The next version of ART is supposed to be built with PySide though :)

The selectionImage flag: This is windows only. This means that when you click on an button with an image, it won't update with another image.

There is literally NO guarantee this will work for everyone. I haven't tested the Perforce code as I don't have a client accessible right now.

I also encountered errors while on a student license on OSX. It would cause Maya to crash when creating the rigs. I suggest that if you do have a student license on OS X, to just run straight through rig creating (like I do in this video : https://vimeo.com/121436469) and set stuff up with defaults. 

Again, all work copyright Epic Games and Jeremy Ernst. Licensing is reflective of the Unreal Engine license. 

Feel free to make fixes!
