;; This file contains a list of remaps/redirects for config file Sections and Keys, so Epic can make changes
;; to the Engine without breaking licensee .ini files. 
;;
;; The config system will remap the names on load, so any saving will use the new names, but with .ini files
;; often being checked into source control, and ini saving can be differential against sections in other files,
;; it's safest to have a human fixup the ini files.
;; 
;; To that end, any remaps that happen will be Warnings in C# utilites, C++ console commands, and in the Editor Message Log.
;; 
;; The main intention of this file is to allow Epic to change section/key names without breaking licensee config files. So,
;; it's not expected that licensees would need to modify this file - instead, licensees can fix up their config files directly
;; instead of modifying a config file like this one.
;;
;; However, if a licensee can't fix the ini file because saved user settings need to be redirected (and can't be fixed easily)
;; a project can have a <ProjectDir>/Config/ConfigRedirects.ini file that will be read.
;;
;; This first section contains a list of section names to be remapped. All other sections are the name of a section that contains
;; one of more keys to remap/redirect, followed up the old and new name of the keys to remap
