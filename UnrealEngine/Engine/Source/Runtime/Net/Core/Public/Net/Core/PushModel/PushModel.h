/**
 * Push Model Support for networking.
 *
 * Note: While the theoretical gains for Push Model are good, in practice the gains seen haven't been as good as expected.
 *			More work may be needed in order to optimize comparisons, and have other systems buy in / use Push Model in order
 *			to increase gains.
 *
 ****************************************************************
 * Rationale
 ****************************************************************
 *
 * The intention of Push Model is to provide a fundamental trade off in the way UE property replication works, without changing
 * the underlying replication machinery.
 *
 * Traditionally, UE Networking works by having coders and designers mark properties as replicated, and then having the network
 * system periodically compare the values of those properties to their last sent state. When we detect a change in the state,
 * then we will send that data to clients.
 *
 * This system works great from the perspective that if there's a change, clients are going to receive it with minimal effort from
 * designers and coders.
 *
 * Where the system starts to fall down is in terms of performance.
 *
 * Because the engine has no way to know if a given Object is "dirty", that means there's no choice but to compare every property
 * on every object. This sort of overhead isn't a big deal while games are relatively small, but as they start to scale up, this
 * can become a bottleneck.
 *
 * To abate this, there's a bunch of machinery UE provides, things like:
 *
 *	Net Frequency
 *		Gives devs the ability to tune how often actors are considered for replication.
 *
 *	Net Dormancy, Replication Keys, Replication Pausing, and Net Relevancy
 *		Gives devs the ability to completely stop replication of Actors and Objects to all connections, or subsets of connections.
 *
 *	Property Conditions, Fast Array Serialization, and Rep Changed Trackers
 *		Gives devs the ability to completely stop replication of specific Properties to all connections, or subsets of connections.
 *
 *	Rep Graph
 *		Gives devs the ability to fine tune when and how Actors are replicated that is much more specific to a game or mode.
 *
 * The main focus of all of these systems is to reduce the number of Actors, Objects, and Properties we consider in an efficient way.
 * The tradeoff all of these things have in common is that it forces devs to be more cognizant of *how* and *when* things need
 * to replicate.
 *
 * Fast Arrays, Replication Keys, and Dormancy are great examples of this, and they have a very similar mechanic to Push Model.
 *
 * With Fast Arrays (see NetSerialization.h), no changes will be replicated unless devs explicitly mark a given Array Property
 * as being dirty. Beyond that, individual elements won't be sent unless they are marked dirty. This means that the replication
 * system only needs to check a few flags / keys, and if they aren't different, it doesn't need to do anything.
 *
 * With Replication Keys (see ActorChannel.h, KeyNeedsToReplicate / ReplicateSubobject), we go up a step and handle changes
 * at the Subobject level. Devs can assign an arbitrary ID and Key to a specific subobject. As they make changes to the
 * Subobject, it's their responsibility to increment or otherwise update the Key. Then, when they go to replicate the
 * subobject (via a call to ReplicateSubobject), they can check the Key for the object to see if it's changed.
 *
 * With Dormancy (see ActorChannel.h, NetDriver.h, NetConnection.h), we again go up a step and handle changes at the Actor
 * level. Devs can decide whether or not a given Actor supports Dormancy, and at what dormant level an actor starts at
 * (i.e., whether it's considered initially "active" in the game, or "inactive" in the game). When an Actor becomes Active
 * (woken from Dormancy), it will replicate one more time to all connections. After that happens, it will return to its
 * dormant state. Once Dormant, it is completely ignored by the networking system until Devs explicitly wake it via a call
 * to something like AActor::ForceNetUpdate.
 *
 * The other benefit to PushModel is that it works at the Object Level, meaning any dirty state can be pushed to / shared
 * across all Net Drivers. This means that we're potentially eliminating multiple property comparisons in cases of
 * things like Server Side Replays.
 *
 ****************************************************************
 * How does it work?
 ****************************************************************
 *
 * With Push Model, we provide a very limited and straightforward interface for allowing Devs to notify the Networking
 * System when they change the value of a property. There are some hooks to help do this automatically for Blueprints,
 * but if they are using things like Blueprint Setters, passing values around by reference, or setting values in Native
 * C++, then it is completely up to them to call the necessary methods.
 *
 * UFUNCTIONS or Blueprint Defined Functions that take Properties by reference will check for Networked Properties and
 * should add nodes automatically (see UNetPushModelHelpers). This is **only** true when they are called from Blueprints!!
 *
 * Devs don't need to care *if* a given object is actually networked or is actively replicating, Push Model handles
 * that sort of tracking internally. As such, we don't expect users to ever need to know or have a reference to
 * any information other than A) The Object that's being dirtied and B) The Property that's being dirtied.
 * Whenever a Property's value is changed, a call to one of the MARK_PROPERTY_DIRTY macros should be added.
 * This will forward the request to Push Model, and it will handle the rest.
 *
 * The preferred way of achieving this is by putting any Replicated Properties behind Getters and Setters.
 * That way, these changes and be made in a single or very limited subset of implementation code, and callers
 * never have to know what's going on.
 *
 * Behind the scenes, Push Model does very simple book keeping, and will forward these dirty notifications on to the
 * networking systems as necessary. The next time an object is replicated, we can simply check a few flags to determine
 * whether or not a given property is dirty. If it is, then we can compare and replicate it normally, otherwise we
 * can quickly skip it.
 *
 * One important thing to note is that at this time, Push Model only supports Top Level properties of Objects
 * (in RepLayout parlance, Parent Commands).
 *
 * So, if changes are made to Structs, Containers, or nested properties therein, the owning Struct or Container
 * property must be marked dirty.
 *
 * This also means that we *must* compare a property when it's dirty to make sure we know exactly what's changed.
 * Optimizations could be made for "network primtiive" types where we skip comparisons if desired, at the potential
 * expense of extra bandwidth for properties that didn't actually change.
