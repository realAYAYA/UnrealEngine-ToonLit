/** Subsystems are auto instanced classes that share the lifetime of certain engine constructs
 * 
 *	Currently supported Subsystem lifetimes are:
 *		Engine		 -> inherit UEngineSubsystem
 *		Editor		 -> inherit UEditorSubsystem
 *		GameInstance -> inherit UGameInstanceSubsystem
 *		World		 -> inherit UWorldSubsystem
 *		LocalPlayer	 -> inherit ULocalPlayerSubsystem
 *
 *
 *	Normal Example:
 *		class UMySystem : public UGameInstanceSubsystem
 *	Which can be accessed by:
 *		UGameInstance* GameInstance = ...;
 *		UMySystem* MySystem = GameInstance->GetSubsystem<UMySystem>();
 *
 *	or the following if you need protection from a null GameInstance
 *		UGameInstance* GameInstance = ...;
 *		UMyGameSubsystem* MySubsystem = UGameInstance::GetSubsystem<MyGameSubsystem>(GameInstance);
 *
 *
 *	You can get also define interfaces that can have multiple implementations.
 *	Interface Example :
 *      MySystemInterface
 *    With 2 concrete derivative classes:
 *      MyA : public MySystemInterface
 *      MyB : public MySystemInterface
 *
 *	Which can be accessed by:
 *		UGameInstance* GameInstance = ...;
 *		const TArray<UMyGameSubsystem*>& MySubsystems = GameInstance->GetSubsystemArray<MyGameSubsystem>();
 *
