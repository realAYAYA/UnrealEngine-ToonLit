/**
 * Dead Blending Node
 *
 * Dead blending is an alternative method of inertialization that extrapolates the animation being transitioned from 
 * forward in time and then performs a normal cross-fade blend between this extrapolated animation and the new animation
 * being transitioned to.
 * 
 * For more background see: https://theorangeduck.com/page/dead-blending
 * 
 * This node works by extrapolating forward the animation being transition from using the animation's velocities at
 * the point of transition, with an exponential decay which reduces those velocities over time to avoid the pose 
 * becoming invalid.
 * 
 * The rate of this decay is set automatically based on how much the velocities of the animation being transitioned 
 * from are moving toward the pose of the animation being transitioned to. If they are moving in the wrong direction or
 * too quickly they will have a larger decay rate, while if they are in the correct direction and moving slowly relative 
 * to the difference they will have a smaller decay rate.
 * 
 * These decay rates can be controlled by the `ExtrapolationHalfLife`, `ExtrapolationHalfLifeMin` and 
 * `ExtrapolationHalfLifeMax` parameters, which specify the approximate average, min, and max decay periods.
 * More specifically they specify the "half-life" - or how it takes for the velocities to be decayed by half.
