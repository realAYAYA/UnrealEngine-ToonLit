/**
 * A DamageType is intended to define and describe a particular form of damage and to provide an avenue 
 * for customizing responses to damage from various sources.
 *
 * For example, a game could make a DamageType_Fire set it up to ignite the damaged actor.
 *
 * DamageTypes are never instanced and should be treated as immutable data holders with static code
 * functionality.  They should never be stateful.
