/** 
 *	This class acts as a base class for a save game object that can be used to save state about the game. 
 *	When you create your own save game subclass, you would add member variables for the information that you want to save.
 *	Then when you want to save a game, create an instance of this object using CreateSaveGameObject, fill in the data, and use SaveGameToSlot, providing a slot name.
 *	To load the game you then just use LoadGameFromSlot, and read the data from the resulting object.
