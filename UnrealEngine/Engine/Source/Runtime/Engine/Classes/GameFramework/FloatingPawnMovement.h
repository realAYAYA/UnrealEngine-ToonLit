 * FloatingPawnMovement is a movement component that provides simple movement for any Pawn class.
 * Limits on speed and acceleration are provided, while gravity is not implemented.
 *
 * Normally the root component of the owning actor is moved, however another component may be selected (see SetUpdatedComponent()).
 * During swept (non-teleporting) movement only collision of UpdatedComponent is considered, attached components will teleport to the end location ignoring collision.
