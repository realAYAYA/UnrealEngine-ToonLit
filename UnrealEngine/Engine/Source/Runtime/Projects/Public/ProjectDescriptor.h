	 * The engine to open this project with. Set this value using IDesktopPlatform::SetEngineIdentifierForProject to ensure that
	 * the most portable value for this field is used.
	 *
	 * This field allows us to open the right version of the engine when you double-click on a .uproject file, and to detect when you 
	 * open a project with a different version of the editor and need the upgrade/downgrade UI flow. The normal engine 
	 * version doesn't work for those purposes, because you can have multiple 4.x branches in various states on one machine.
	 *
	 * For Launcher users, this field gets set to something stable like "4.7" or "4.8", so you can swap projects and game binaries 
	 * between users, and it'll automatically work on any platform or machine regardless of where the engine is installed. You 
	 * can only have one binary release of each major engine version installed at once.
	 * 
	 * For Perforce or Git users that branch the engine along with their games, this field is left blank. You can sync the repository 
	 * down on any platform and machine, and it can figure out which engine a project should use by looking up the directory 
	 * hierarchy until it finds one.
	 * 
	 * For other cases, where you have a source build of the engine but are working with a foreign project, we use a random identifier 
	 * for each local engine installation and use the registry to map it back to the engine directory. All bets are off as to which
	 * engine you should use to open it on a different machine, and using a random GUID ensures that every new machine triggers the
	 * engine selection UI when you open or attempt to generate project files for it.
	 * 
	 * For users which mount the engine through a Git submodule (where the engine is in a subdirectory of the project), this field 
	 * can be manually edited to be a relative path.
