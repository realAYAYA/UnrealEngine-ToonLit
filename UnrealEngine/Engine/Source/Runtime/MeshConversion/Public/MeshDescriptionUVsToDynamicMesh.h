/**
 * Converter that gives a specific UV layer of a provided mesh description and turns it into a flat
 * FDynamicMesh, with vertices corresponding to UV elements, and their positions corresponding to
 * those elements' UV coordinate values. The triangle id's in the dynamic mesh will correspond to
 * original triangles of the mesh.
 * 
 * The converter can also bake back such a dynamic mesh to an existing mesh description UV layer
 * after the dynamic mesh has been modified. The important part is that the triangle IDs continue
 * to correspond to each other. This means that while welding/splitting vertices in the dynamic
 * mesh is ok, adding or removing triangles is not.
 * 
 * The converter prefers shared UVs when they are available, though it will populate instanced
 * UVs as well on the way back.
