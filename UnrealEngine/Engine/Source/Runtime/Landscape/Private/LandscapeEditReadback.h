/** 
 * Read back queue for a landscape edit layer texture.
 * This handles reading landscape edit data back from the GPU to the game thread.
 * Multiple read backs can be queued in a single object and any completed results can be retrieved.
 * Tick() must be called regularly to update the internal read back tasks.
 * When results are available GetCompletedResultNum() will be greater than zero.
 * After getting latest results with GetResult()/GetResultContext() you should call ReleaseCompletedResults() to prevent leaks.
