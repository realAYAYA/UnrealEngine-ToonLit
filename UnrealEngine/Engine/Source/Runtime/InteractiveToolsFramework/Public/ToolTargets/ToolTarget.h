/**
 * A tool target is a stand-in object that a tool can operate on. It exposes the necessary
 * interfaces to the tool.
 *
 * There are two intended purposes of the tool target system:
 * 1. Allow tools to operate on arbitrary objects as long as they can be made to provide the 
 *   tool with the necessary inputs. For instance, a mesh editing tool should be able to operate
 *   on skeletal, static, volume, and other mesh as long as the target manager has a registered
 *   factory that can use that type of mesh to create a suitable target.
 * 2. (not yet used) Help cache tool inputs. I.e., if a tool requires an expensive
 *   conversion before it can work on an item, the converted result can be stored in the
 *   tool target which can be cached by the target manager and provided the next time the
 *   same type of target is requested for that item.
 * 
 * Given an object, tool builders usually ask the target manager to turn it into a target that
 * has the interfaces the tools needs. The tools cast the target to those interfaces to use
 * them.
