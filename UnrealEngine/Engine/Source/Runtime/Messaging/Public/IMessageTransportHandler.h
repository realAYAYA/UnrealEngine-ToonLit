/**
 * Interface for message transport event handlers.
 *
 * This interface is typically implemented by message bridges and other classes
 * that manage a message transport and wish to receive messages from it. This
 * interface also notifies implementors of discovered and lost transport nodes.
 *
 * A transport node is the internal representation of a remote message endpoint
 * that may exist in a different process or on a different computer. The actual
 * implementation of these nodes depends on the transport layer. It may be a
 * network socket connection, a named pipe, or some other communication technology.
 *
 * Each transport node gets a globally unique identifier that can be used by a
 * message bridge to translate local message addresses to remote message endpoints.
 * When a message endpoint on the message bus sends a message to a specific message
 * address that represents a remote endpoint, the message bridge maps the address
 * to a transport identifier, which is then mapped again to the corresponding
 * connection in the transport layer.
 *
 * @see IMessageBridge, IMessageBus, IMessageContext, IMessageTransport
