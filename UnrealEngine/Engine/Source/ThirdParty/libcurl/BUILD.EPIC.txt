----------------------------------------------------------------------
summary
----------------------------------------------------------------------

the build script will build:
- zlib
- OpenSSL
- libcurl
- libwebsockets
- webRTC

the configuration (build flags and dependancy paths) and some pretty specific
build commands sequences -- which were also sometimes different (e.g. pathname
vs. filename) depending on what platform was being built -- were all written
down.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(see build scripts function: build_environment() for more details)

- windows:
  o Visual Studio (2013 & 2015)
  o CMake
  o Git for Windows (can be install with minimal "Use Git Bash only")

- mac & linux
  o autoconf automake libtool
  o CMake
  o git
  o perl sed


----------------------------------------------------------------------
TO RUN THE BUILD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- NOTE: OpenSSL will NOT build if the path contains a space in the path

- that said, this script builds "stand-alone"

- in other words, you can do something like this
  (windows devs, remember to use git bash):

  mkdir -p /isolated
  cp BUILD.EPIC.sh COPY.EPIC.sh /isolated/.
  cd /isolated
  ./BUILD.EPIC.sh


----------------------------------------------------------------------
deploy
----------------------------------------------------------------------
the build script will also "install" the compiled files into a folder (within
each library folders) to help make finding them easier.

- e.g. /isolated/<libraryName>/INSTALL.<libraryVersion>/<platform>/...


(see build scripts function: configure_platform() for additional info)

<strike>
copy/move them to the proper folder locations in Engine/Source/ThirdParty/...
</strike>

you can use the helper script [ COPY.EPIC.sh ] to copy the "installed" files
(from the stand-alone path) back to your working perforce workspace root path.
- EDIT [ LOCAL_WORKSPACE ] to point to your perforce workspace root path !!!
