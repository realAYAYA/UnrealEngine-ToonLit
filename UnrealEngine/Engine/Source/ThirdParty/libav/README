How to build libav
------------------

libav is a wrapper around libavcodec and libavutil to provide support for video
and audio decoders to Unreal Engine's Media Framework on Linux.

Due to the complexity of these libraries and their dependencies to additional
libraries needed for hardware support, we do not provide pre-built libraries.

We recommend you install the necessary packages matching your Linux distribution
from the usual sources.

Depending on your decoder needs you may need to install the "libavcodec-extra"
package if the base package does not include those you require.
This plugin is intended to provide the following decoders:
Video: H.264 (AVC), H.265 (HEVC)
Audio: AAC

In addition you will need to install the development package "libavcodec-dev"
to get the C header files matching the version of your libavcodec installation.
These are required for compilation of this plugin.

Due to the nature of the build system the standard system include folders are
not searched when building.
You should not add them to the build process either since this will result in
conflicts with the provided toolchain sources.

Instead it is recommended that you either copy the relevant files into this
project here or create symbolic links to the original files.

The locations where this plugin expects to find the libavcodec sources are:
  {ThisFolder}/include/libavcodec/
  {ThisFolder}/include/libavutil/
  {ThisFolder}/lib/Linux/{Archictecture}/libavcodec.so
  {ThisFolder}/lib/Linux/{Archictecture}/libavutil.so
where {Archictecture} is either "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu" or
"aarch64-unknown-linux-gnueabi" as expected by Unreal Build Tool.

At the time of this writing the versions of the libraries are as follows:
libavcodec: 58.54.100
libavutil: 56.31.100

Be advised that you will need to have the correct C header files installed
for whichever version of the libraries you plan to use.
If there is a mismatch between what headers you made available when building
this plugin versus the version found in the library you will get a warning
message logged to the console when launching your project and libav will be
unavailable.

To install the packages on Ubuntu Linux enter the following commands in a shell:
(1) Update the package list
  sudo apt-get update -y

(2) Install the package of a specific version
    (where XX is the version you want to install, eg. 58)
  sudo apt-get install libavcodec.XX

(3) If you need the package with additional codecs
  sudo apt-get install libavcodec-extra

(4) Get the header files for development
  sudo apt-get install -y libavcodec-dev

You should then have (depending on the architecture, see above)
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libavcodec.so
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libavutil.so
  /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/libavcodec
  /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/libavutil

To create the required symbolic links needed to build this project navigate to
this location in a shell, eg. cd ~/Unreal/Engine/Source/ThirdParty/libav

Then, depending on where the header and library files were installed and the
desired architecture, enter:
  ln -s /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/libavcodec include/
  ln -s /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/libavutil include/
  mkdir -p lib/Linux/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
  ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libavcodec.so lib/Linux/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/
  ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libavutil.so lib/Linux/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/

you must then generate your project files again by issuing eg:
  cd ~/Unreal/Engine
  ./GenerateProjectFiles.sh

The next build should then pick up on the existence of libavcodec and build this
plugin with support for it.
