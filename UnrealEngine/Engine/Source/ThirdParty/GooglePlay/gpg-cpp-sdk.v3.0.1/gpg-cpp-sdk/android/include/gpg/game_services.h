/**
 * The starting point for interacting with Google Play Games.
 *
 * <h3>Game Services Lifecycle</h3>
 *
 * An instance of the GameServices class is created via a GameServices::Builder.
 * When created, the instance is initially not signed into the Game Services
 * (that is, IsAuthorized() will return false). A silent sign-in attempt is
 * initiated in the background, and may succeed if a user was signed in at the
 * end of a previous session. Until the completion of this silent sign-in
 * attempt, any user authentication UI (for example, sign-in and/or sign-out
 * buttons) should be disabled or hidden.
 *
 * At the completion of this silent sign-in attempt, the OnAuthActionFinished
 * callback for the GameServices instance (registered with
 * GameServices::Builder::SetOnAuthActionFinished) will be notified. If the
 * callback arguments reflect a successful sign-in attempt, the instance can be
 * assumed to be connected to Game Services (that is, IsAuthorized() will return
 * true), and sign-out UI should be enabled. If the callback argument reflects a
 * failed sign-in attempt, sign-in UI should be enabled.
 *
 * Explicit sign-out via the SignOut() method should be invoked only at user
 * request. This requests a transition to a signed out state. The completion of
 * this transition is indicated by an invocation of the OnAuthActionFinished
 * callback. Until such a time as this callback is invoked, other GameServices
 * APIs (including StartAuthorizationUI()) should not be called.
 *
 * When a GameServices instance is destructed, it will block until there are no
 * pending operations to avoid data loss. If this block-on-destruction behavior
 * is not desired, a Flush() should be issued and the GameServices instance
 * should be kept alive until the Flush() completes.
 *
 * For GameServices to function properly on Android versions less than 4.0, the
 * owning Activity must call lifecycle callbacks. See AndroidSupport.
