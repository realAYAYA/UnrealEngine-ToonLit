 * called, either android_main or ANativeActivity_onCreate should be used.
 * android_main is used when building a NativeActivity using
 * android_native_app_glue.h. ANativeActivity_onCreate is used when building a
 * NativeActivity using just native_activity.h. android_native_app_glue.h and
 * native_activity.h are default Android headers.
 *
 * The appropriate initialization function must be called exactly once before
 * any AndroidPlatformConfiguration instance methods are called, and it must be
 * called before a GameServices object is instantiated. It is permitted to
 * instantiate a AndroidPlatformConfiguration before one of the initialization
 * calls (for example, if the configuration object has global scope), as long as
 * no methods are called before the initialization call. These methods need be
 * called only once in the lifetime of the calling program, not once per
 * GameServices object created.
