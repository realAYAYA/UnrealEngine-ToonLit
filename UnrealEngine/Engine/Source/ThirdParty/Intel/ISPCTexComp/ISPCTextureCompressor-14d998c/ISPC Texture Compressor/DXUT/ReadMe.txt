DXUT FOR DIRECT3D 11
--------------------

Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

July 12, 2018

DXUT is a "GLUT"-like framework for Direct3D 11.x Win32 desktop applications; primarily
samples, demos, and prototypes.

This code is designed to build with Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 or Visual Studio 2017.
It is recommended that you make use of VS 2015 Update 3, Windows Tools 1.4.1, and the
Windows 10 Anniversary Update SDK (14393) or VS 2017 (15.7 update) or later with the
Windows 10 April 2018 Update SDK (17134).

These components are designed to work without requiring any content from the DirectX SDK. For details,
see "Where is the DirectX SDK?" <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee663275.aspx>.

----------
DISCLAIMER
----------

DXUT is being provided as a porting aid for older code that makes use of the legacy DirectX SDK, the deprecated D3DX9/D3DX11
library, and the DXUT11 framework. It is a cleaned up version of the original DXUT11 that will build with the Windows 8.1 SDK
and does not make use of any legacy DirectX SDK or DirectSetup deployed components.

The DXUT framework is for use in Win32 desktop applications. It not usable for Universal Windows Platform apps, Windows Store apps,
Xbox One apps, or Windows phone.
 
This version of DXUT only supports Direct3D 11, and therefore is not compatible with Windows XP or early versions of Windows Vista.

RELEASE NOTES
-------------

* The VS 2017 projects make use of /permissive- for improved C++ standard conformance. Use of a Windows 10 SDK prior to
  the Fall Creators Update (16299) may result in failures due to problems with the system headers. You can work around
  these by disabling this switch in the project files which is found in the <ConformanceMode> or <AdditionalOptions>
  elements.
