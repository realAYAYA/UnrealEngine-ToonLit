    radv: do not update the number of scissors in vkCmdSetScissor()

    The Vulkan spec (1.0.61) says:

       "The number of scissors used by a pipeline is still specified
        by the scissorCount member of VkPipelinescissorStateCreateInfo."

    So, the number of scissors is defined at pipeline creation
    time and shouldn't be updated when they are set dynamically.
