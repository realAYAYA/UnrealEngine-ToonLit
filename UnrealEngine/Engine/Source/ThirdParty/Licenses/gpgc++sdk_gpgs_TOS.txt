Google Play Games Services Terms of Service

Last modified: March 13th, 2014

By using this API, you consent to be bound by these terms in addition to the Google APIs Terms of Service ("API ToS") at http://developers.google.com/terms.

Section 1: Developer Content Policies

You agree to comply with the Google+ Platform Developer Policies set forth at http://developers.google.com/+/policies and the Google Play content policies set forth at http://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html (or other such URLs as Google may provide for this purpose from time to time).

The content of your API Client, including any content supplied by your users or other content providers, must follow the Google+ User Content and Conduct Policy at http://www.google.com/intl/en/+/policy/content.html.

Section 2: Advertisements

Data Usage You may not use user data from our APIs for advertising purposes, unless: (i) you are explicitly authorized by Google, or (ii) you are using an advertising solution that Google provides for this purpose. You may not, and may not permit any third party to, sell or transmit any user data received from our APIs (including anonymized, aggregate or derivative data) to any third-party ad network or service, data broker, or other advertising or marketing provider.

Directly Sold Ads Notwithstanding the foregoing or section B(1) of the Google+ Platform Developer Policies, and provided that you don’t operate as an ad network, you may use user data from our APIs to target ads within your API Client where you have sold the ad slot to the advertiser directly (“Directly Sold Ads”), and you may make anonymized user data from our APIs available to a third party solely to enable that third party to serve Directly Sold Ads to your API Client.

3PAS Restrictions If you have third party advertising in your API Client which is provided by a Google advertising solution, you must use an approved Third-Party Ad Serving ("3PAS") provider subject to Google's current 3PAS policies at http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=94230.

Abuse Google reserves the right to block any advertising provider, or any advertisement, from your API Client for any reason, including but not limited to: (i) user abuse concerns regarding an advertisement or advertising provider; or (ii) an advertising provider preventing reciprocal ad serving by Google.

Section 3: Gameplay Information

You shall not permit your API Client to: (1) submit to Google any false gameplay information (such as invalid scores for a user in a leaderboard, or an achievement that a user did not earn); (2) send or accept an invite to, or take a turn in, a multiplayer game (including automatching requests) without an explicit approval from a user; or (3) send, request, or accept an in-game gift, without an explicit approval from a user.

Section 4: Privacy

For API Clients that use their own avatar/naming system in place of the user's Google+ identity then you must make clear to users that their gameplay information will still be submitted to Google and associated with their Google+ identity and viewable within different Google products.

You shall not permit your API Client to reveal the user’s Google+ identity to other users in multiplayer matches where players are automatically matched using Google Play games services.

Section 5: Submission of Content

The "Submission of Content" provision in Section 5 of the API ToS is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

"Some of our APIs allow the submission of content, and except as expressly provided in these Terms, Google does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client. By submitting, posting or displaying content to or from the APIs through your API Client, you give Google a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to use, host, store, reproduce, adapt, modify, create derivative works, communicate, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content only for the purpose of enabling Google to provide and improve the APIs and our services and to develop new ones, in accordance with the applicable Google privacy policies. You agree that this license includes a right for Google to make such content available to other companies, organizations or individuals (including the end user): (a) with whom Google has relationships for the provision of syndicated services, and to use such content in connection with the provision of those services; or (b) where the applicable end user of your API Client directs Google to make such content available. Before you submit content to our APIs through your API Client, ensure that you have the necessary rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license."

Nothing in this Section 5 is intended to grant Google a license to make the API Client available on our properties following Your notice of termination as set forth in Section 8 of the API ToS.

Section 6: Indemnification

The "Indemnification" provision in Section 9 of the API ToS is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

"You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Google, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and employees, or partners, from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to:

	* your misuse of Google Play games services
	* your violation of these Terms; or
	* any third party's misuse of Google Play games services or actions that would constitute a violation of these terms provided that you enabled such third party to access the APIs or failed to take reasonable steps to prevent such third party from accessing the APIs, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees, of every kind and nature. In such a case, Google will provide you with written notice of such claim, suit or action."

Section 7: Object Code License

Any Google-provided object code that calls the APIs shall be considered part of the APIs. Subject to these terms, you may copy and distribute this code solely for inclusion as part of your API Client(s). Google and its licensors own all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property and other proprietary rights, in and to this code. You will not modify, translate, or create derivative works of the code.
