     DISCLAIMERS.

4.2. Open Source Software. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT
     INCLUDING THIS Section 4.2. AND SECTION 6 BELOW, ALL OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED
     “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. NVIDIA MELLANOX AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO
     WARRANTY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND
     THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
     RELATING TO THE USE OF SUCH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE. IN NO EVENT SHALL NVIDIA MELLANOX
     OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS
     OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE; DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND
     ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
     NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPEN SOURCE
     SOFTWARE OR THE USE OF SUCH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
     SUCH DAMAGE.
4.3. No Support. NVIDIA MELLANOX is under no obligation to provide any support, patches, fixes, subsequent
    versions, or upgrades (collectively “Support”) for the Software or Documentation, unless Licensee purchased the
    support package from NVIDIA Mellanox.

 5. CONFIDENTIALITY.
 5.1. Use. Each party understands that the other party has or may disclose Confidential Information in the course of
    exercising its rights or performing its obligations under this Agreement. As between the parties, the Confidential
    Information of each party will remain its sole property. Confidential Information will be used by the recipient party
    only for purposes of, or as otherwise authorized by, this Agreement. Except as expressly provided herein, each party
    will hold the Confidential Information of the other party in strict confidence and protect such Confidential Information
    from disclosure using the same care it uses to protect its own confidential information of like importance, but not
    less than reasonable care. Except as expressly provided herein, no Confidential Information will be disclosed by the
    receiving party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party. The party employing or engaging such
    persons is responsible and liable for their compliance with such confidentiality obligations.
5.2. Treatment. The parties recognize and agree that the use or disclosure of any Confidential Information of a party in a
    manner inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement may cause the disclosing party irrevocable damage for which
    adequate remedy at law may not be available. Accordingly, each party shall be entitled to seek temporary and/or
    permanent injunctive relief against such breach or violation from any court of competent jurisdiction immediately upon
    request, without the need to obtain a bond or other security. The right of each party to seek injunctive relief shall
    not limit in any manner that party's right to seek other and/or additional remedies at law or in equity. If Confidential
    Information is required to be disclosed by law or a governmental authority, including pursuant to a subpoena or
    court order, such Confidential Information may be disclosed, provided that the party required to disclose the
    Confidential Information: (i) promptly notifies the disclosing party of the disclosure requirement; (ii) cooperates
    with the disclosing party's reasonable efforts to resist or narrow the disclosure and to obtain an order or other
    reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the disclosing party's Confidential Information;
    and (iii) furnishes only Confidential Information that the party is legally compelled to disclose according to advice
    of its legal counsel. Upon written request, or at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, all documented
    Confidential Information (and all copies thereof) owned by the requesting party will be returned or destroyed by the
    receiving party, with written certification thereof delivered to the other party.
  6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
  6.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA MELLANOX AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL
     NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL
     DAMAGES OF ANY KIND RELATING TO THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
     LIABILITY IS BASED ON BREACH OF A CONTRACTUAL, STATUTORY OR COMMON LAW DUTY OF
     ANY KIND. IN NO EVENT SHALL NVIDIA MELLANOX AND ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS
     OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF USE, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR
     DESTRUCTION OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING FROM USE OF THE SOFTWARE EVEN IF NVIDIA
     MELLANOX AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
     EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS BASED ON LICENSEE’S BREACH OF ANY LICENSE GRANT OR
     CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATION, IN THE EVENT THAT ANY LIABILITY IS IMPOSED ON EITHER PARTY FOR
     ANY REASON WHATSOEVER HEREUNDER, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY EITHER PARTY
NVIDIA Rivermax License Agreement                        3 of 7
     TO THE OTHER BY REASON THEREOF SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00). These
     exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply regardless if NVIDIA Mellanox or its affiliates have been advised of
     the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a remedy fails its essential purpose. Licensee
     acknowledges that the foregoing limitations are an essential element of the Agreement between the parties
     and that in the absence of such limitations the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement would be
     substantially different.

  7. TERM AND TERMINATION.

     this Agreement.

     Agreement. Any ambiguity in this Agreement shall be interpreted equitably without regard to which party drafted
     the Agreement or any provision thereof. The terms "this Agreement," "hereof," "hereunder" and any similar
     expressions refer to this Agreement and not to any particular Section or other portion hereof. The parties hereto

NVIDIA Rivermax License Agreement                          4 of 7
      and "including," and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation" and
      "discretion" means sole discretion.
   8.6. Amendment. Unless otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not be changed, waived, discharged,
      or terminated orally, but only by a written document signed by duly authorized officers of each of the parties
      hereto.
   8.7. Relationship of Parties. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to create an agency, joint venture or partnership
      relation between the parties hereto. It is understood and agreed that Licensee is not, by reason of this Agreement
      or anything herein contained, constituted or appointed the agent or representative of NVIDIA Mellanox for any
      purpose whatsoever, nor shall anything herein contained be deemed or construed as granting to Licensee
      any right or authority to assume or to create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, for, on behalf
      of, or in the name of NVIDIA Mellanox, or to bind NVIDIA Mellanox in any way or manner whatsoever. All financial
      and other obligations associated with Licensee's business are the sole responsibility of Licensee.

      the extent Licensee exports, re-exports, or imports the Software, technology, or technical data licensed or provided
      hereunder, Licensee assumes sole responsibility for complying with applicable laws and regulations and for
      obtaining required export and import authorizations. NVIDIA Mellanox may terminate this Agreement if you are
      in violation of any applicable laws or regulations. You agree that NVIDIA Mellanox may audit your compliance with
      this Agreement. Any such audit would be at NVIDIA Mellanox’ expense, require reasonable notice, and would be
      performed during normal business hours.
   8.10. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of the Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as
      to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of the Agreement is held to be prohibited by or

      without invalidating the remainder of the Agreement.

      made or existing between the parties hereto prior to or simultaneously with this Agreement, and this
      Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties hereto.
