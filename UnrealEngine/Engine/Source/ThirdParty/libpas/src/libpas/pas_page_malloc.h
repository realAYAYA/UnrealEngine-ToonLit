/* This is an mmap on POSIX, a VirtualAlloc on Windows, or the equivalent of those things if we ever support other
   OSes.
   
   If you pass commit_mode = pas_decommitted, then it's as if we had called pas_page_malloc_decommit(pas_may_mmap)
   on the returned memory. On some OSes, this is natively supported as a single syscall that reserved decommitted
   memory (like Windows).
   
   Note that different OSes handle commit_mode in different ways.
   
   On Linux and Darwin, you really want to use pas_committed all the time. Passing pas_decommitted doesn't really do
   much. Using that option makes this call more expensive, but doesn't achieve much.
   
   On Windows, it makes sense to pass either pas_committed or pas_decommitted, and it's important to use the latter
   in those cases where a large fraction of the requested memory is never going to be used.
   
   If reserving memory that you don't want to use, you should pass pas_reservation_commit_mode as the commit_mode.
   Then, when you do want to use some of the reserved memory, call pas_reservation_commit on that memory. See
   comment above pas_reservation_commit_mode in pas_reservation.h. */
