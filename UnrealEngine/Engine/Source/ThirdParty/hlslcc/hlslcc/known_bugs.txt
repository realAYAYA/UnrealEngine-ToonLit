"inline" interpreted as reserved word instead of keyword
  FIXED - CL 1472491

"attribute" mistakenly recognized as keyword instead of identifier
  FIXED - CL 1472491

Array syntax is more strict than fxc
  float foo[3+3.0]; // compiles in fxc, fails in hlslcc

No support for "string" type
  no known practical use, but fxc does recognize it

No support for string literals
  required for attribute support (GS, HS, DS)
  FIXED - CL 1472867

No support for num_samples argument to Texture2DMS template
  Texture2DMS<float4,4> fails to compile
  Explicit sample count is required for DX10, but not DX11.
  Partially fixed - CL 1483861. Compiling as Texture2DMS<float4>.
  Ignoring the num_samples value.

Structure instantiation as 'struct Type VariableName' is not recognized.
  Only 'Type VariableName' works.

Due to modelling vertex and geometry shader outputs and pixel shader
inputs as structure members (structures become interface blocks at
GLSL code generation), Mesa IR code optimizations may be suboptimal.
  Modelling only geometry shader inputs as contained in structures
  and adding interface block defintions to the rest of variables at
  GLSL code generation phase could be an improvement.

Method calls on textures don't fully type check
  It is possible to call Sample with an invalid set of arguments

f32tof16 and f16tof32 may be sub-optimal
  GLSL only defines a vec2->uint pack function
  HLSL has the app perform the packing

No support for GatherCmpRed
  GLSL lacks compare / select functions on samplers

No support for operator[] or .mips on Texture*
  HLSL added these as aliases to the Load operation

No support for TextureCubeArray
