		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	Resolving involves two sets of files, a source and a target.  The

		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	Resolving can modify workspace files. To back up files, use 'p4
		/// <br/> 	shelve' before using 'p4 resolve'.
		/// <br/>

		/// <br/> 	files are referred to as follows:
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	  'yours'       The target file open in the client workspace
		/// <br/> 	  'theirs'      The source file in the depot
		/// <br/> 	  'base'        The common ancestor; the highest revision of the
		/// <br/> 	                source file already accounted for in the target.
		/// <br/> 	  'merged'      The merged result.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	Filenames, filetypes, and text file content can be resolved by 
		/// <br/> 	accepting 'yours', 'theirs', or 'merged'.  Branching, deletion, and
		/// <br/> 	binary file content can be resolved by accepting either 'yours' or
		/// <br/> 	'theirs'.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	When resolving integrated changes, 'p4 resolve' distinguishes among
		/// <br/> 	four results: entirely yours, entirely theirs, a pure merge, or an
		/// <br/> 	edited merge.  The distinction is recorded when resolved files are
		/// <br/> 	submitted, and will be used by future commands to determine whether
		/// <br/> 	integration is needed.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	In all cases, accepting 'yours' leaves the target file in its current
		/// <br/> 	state.  The result of accepting 'theirs' is as follows:
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	   Content:     The target file content is overwritten.
		/// <br/> 	   Attribute:   The target's attributes are replaced.
		/// <br/>  	   Branching:	A new target is branched.
		/// <br/>  	   Deletion:    The target file is deleted.
		/// <br/>  	   Filename:	The target file is moved or renamed.
		/// <br/>  	   Filetype:    The target file's type is changed.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	For each unresolved change, the user is prompted to accept a result.
		/// <br/> 	Content and non-content changes are resolved separately.  For content,
		/// <br/> 	'p4 resolve' places the merged result into a temporary file in the

		/// <br/> 	conflict markers that must be removed by the user.

		/// <br/> 	
		/// <br/> 	'p4 resolve' works only on files that have been scheduled to be 
		/// <br/> 	resolved.  The commands that can schedule resolves are: 'p4 sync',
		/// <br/> 	'p4 update', 'p4 submit', 'p4 merge', and 'p4 integrate'.  Files must
		/// <br/> 	be resolved before they can be submitted.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	Resolving involves two sets of files, a source and a target.  The
		/// <br/> 	target is a set of depot files that maps to opened files in the
		/// <br/> 	client workspace.  When resolving an integration, the source is a
		/// <br/> 	different set of depot files than the target.  When resolving an
		/// <br/> 	update, the source is the same set of depot files as the target,
		/// <br/> 	at a different revision.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The 'p4 resolve' file argument specifies the target.  If the file
		/// <br/> 	argument is omitted, all unresolved files are resolved.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	Resolving can modify workspace files. To back up files, use 'p4
		/// <br/> 	shelve' before using 'p4 resolve'.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The resolve process is a classic three-way merge. The participating
		/// <br/> 	files are referred to as follows:
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	  'yours'       The target file open in the client workspace
		/// <br/> 	  'theirs'      The source file in the depot
		/// <br/> 	  'base'        The common ancestor; the highest revision of the
		/// <br/> 	                source file already accounted for in the target.
		/// <br/> 	  'merged'      The merged result.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	Filenames, filetypes, and text file content can be resolved by 
		/// <br/> 	accepting 'yours', 'theirs', or 'merged'.  Branching, deletion, and
		/// <br/> 	binary file content can be resolved by accepting either 'yours' or
		/// <br/> 	'theirs'.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	When resolving integrated changes, 'p4 resolve' distinguishes among
		/// <br/> 	four results: entirely yours, entirely theirs, a pure merge, or an
		/// <br/> 	edited merge.  The distinction is recorded when resolved files are
		/// <br/> 	submitted, and will be used by future commands to determine whether
		/// <br/> 	integration is needed.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	In all cases, accepting 'yours' leaves the target file in its current
		/// <br/> 	state.  The result of accepting 'theirs' is as follows:
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	   Content:     The target file content is overwritten.
		/// <br/> 	   Attribute:   The target's attributes are replaced.
		/// <br/>  	   Branching:	A new target is branched.
		/// <br/>  	   Deletion:    The target file is deleted.
		/// <br/>  	   Filename:	The target file is moved or renamed.
		/// <br/>  	   Filetype:    The target file's type is changed.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	For each unresolved change, the user is prompted to accept a result.
		/// <br/> 	Content and non-content changes are resolved separately.  For content,
		/// <br/> 	'p4 resolve' places the merged result into a temporary file in the
		/// <br/> 	client workspace.  If there are any conflicts, the merged file contains
		/// <br/> 	conflict markers that must be removed by the user.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	'p4 resolve' displays a count of text diffs and conflicts, and offers

		/// <br/> 	Sync updates the client workspace to reflect its current view (if
		/// <br/> 	it has changed) and the current contents of the depot (if it has
		/// <br/> 	changed). The client view maps client and depot file names and
		/// <br/> 	locations.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	Sync adds files that are in the client view and have not been
		/// <br/> 	retrieved before.  Sync deletes previously retrieved files that
		/// <br/> 	are no longer in the client view or have been deleted from the
		/// <br/> 	depot.  Sync updates files that are still in the client view and
		/// <br/> 	have been updated in the depot.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	By default, sync affects all files in the client workspace. If file
		/// <br/> 	arguments are given, sync limits its operation to those files.
		/// <br/> 	The file arguments can contain wildcards.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	If the file argument includes a revision specifier, then the given
		/// <br/> 	revision is retrieved.  Normally, the head revision is retrieved.
		/// <br/> 	See 'p4 help revisions' for help specifying revisions.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	If the file argument includes a revision range specification,
		/// <br/> 	only files selected by the revision range are updated, and the
		/// <br/> 	highest revision in the range is used.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	Normally, sync does not overwrite workspace files that the user has
		/// <br/> 	manually made writable.  Setting the 'clobber' option in the
		/// <br/> 	client specification disables this safety check.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -f flag forces resynchronization even if the client already
		/// <br/> 	has the file, and overwriting any writable files.  This flag doesn't
		/// <br/> 	affect open files.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -L flag can be used with multiple file arguments that are in
		/// <br/> 	full depot syntax and include a valid revision number. When this
		/// <br/> 	flag is used the arguments are processed together by building an
		/// <br/> 	internal table similar to a label. This file list processing is
		/// <br/> 	significantly faster than having to call the internal query engine
		/// <br/> 	for each individual file argument. However, the file argument syntax
		/// <br/> 	is strict and the command will not run if an error is encountered.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -n flag previews the operation without updating the workspace.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -N flag also previews the operation without updating the
		/// <br/> 	workspace, but reports only a summary of the work the sync would do.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -k flag updates server metadata without syncing files. It is
		/// <br/> 	intended to enable you to ensure that the server correctly reflects
		/// <br/> 	the state of files in the workspace while avoiding a large data
		/// <br/> 	transfer. Caution: an erroneous update can cause the server to
		/// <br/> 	incorrectly reflect the state of the workspace.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -p flag populates the client workspace, but does not update the
		/// <br/> 	server to reflect those updates.  Any file that is already synced or
		/// <br/> 	opened will be bypassed with a warning message.  This option is very
		/// <br/> 	useful for build clients or when publishing content without the
		/// <br/> 	need to track the state of the client workspace.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -q flag suppresses normal output messages. Messages regarding
		/// <br/> 	errors or exceptional conditions are not suppressed.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -r flag allows open files which are mapped to new locations
		/// <br/> 	in the depot to be reopened in the new location.  By default, open
		/// <br/> 	workspace files remain associated with the depot files that they were
		/// <br/> 	originally opened as.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -s flag adds a safety check before sending content to the client
		/// <br/> 	workspace.  This check uses MD5 digests to compare the content on the
		/// <br/> 	clients workspace against content that was last synced.  If the file
		/// <br/> 	has been modified outside of Perforce's control then an error message
		/// <br/> 	is displayed and the file is not overwritten.  This check adds some
		/// <br/> 	extra processing which will affect the performance of the operation.
		/// <br/> 	Clients with 'allwrite' and 'noclobber' set do this check by default.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -m flag limits sync to the first 'max' number of files. This
		/// <br/> 	option is useful in conjunction with tagged output and the '-n'
		/// <br/> 	flag, to preview how many files will be synced without transferring
		/// <br/> 	all the file data.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The --parallel flag specifies options for parallel file transfer. If
		/// <br/> 	your administrator has enabled parallel file transfer by setting the
		/// <br/> 	net.parallel.max configurable, and if there are sufficient resources
		/// <br/> 	across the system, a sync command may execute more rapidly by

		/// <br/> 	View:        Maps files in the depot to files in your client
		/// <br/> 		     workspace.  Defines the files that you want in your
		/// <br/> 		     client workspace and specifies where you want them
		/// <br/> 		     to reside.  The default view maps all depot files
		/// <br/> 		     onto the client.  See 'p4 help views' for view syntax.
		/// <br/> 		     A new view takes effect on the next 'p4 sync'.

		/// <br/> 		     (Files in stream paths can be submitted only by dedicated
		/// <br/> 		     stream clients.) When this optional field is set, the
		/// <br/> 		     View field will be automatically replaced by a stream
		/// <br/> 		     view as the client spec is saved.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	StreamAtChange:
		/// <br/> 		     Stream meta-data (for view creation) is versioned.

		/// <br/> 		     available to clients in the past. With this field set
		/// <br/> 		     changes cannot be be submitted from the client.
		/// <br/> 		     StreamAtChange is optional; Stream must be set as well.

		/// <br/> 	ServerID:    If set, restricts usage to the named server.
		/// <br/> 		     If unset, usage is allowed on the master server and on
		/// <br/> 		     any replicas of the master other than Edge Servers.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	Note: changing the client root does not actually move the client
		/// <br/> 	files; you must relocate them manually.  Similarly, changing
		/// <br/> 	the 'LineEnd' option does not actually update the client files;
		/// <br/> 	you can refresh them with 'p4 sync -f'.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -d flag deletes the specified spec, as long as the client
		/// <br/> 	workspace has no opened files or pending changes.  (See 'p4 help
		/// <br/> 	opened'.) The -f flag forces the delete. The -Fs option used with -f
		/// <br/> 	forces client deletion even when the user has shelved changes. In
		/// <br/> 	this case, the shelved changes are left intact.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -o flag writes the named client spec to the standard output.
		/// <br/> 	The user's editor is not invoked.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -i flag reads a client spec from the standard input.  The
		/// <br/> 	user's editor is not invoked.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -t template flag, where 'template' is the name of another client
		/// <br/> 	spec, causes the View and Options fields to be replaced by those of
		/// <br/> 	the template.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -f flag can force the updating of locked clients; normally
		/// <br/> 	locked clients can only be modified by their owner.  -f also allows
		/// <br/> 	the last modified date to be set.  The -f flag requires 'admin'
		/// <br/> 	access granted by 'p4 protect'.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -s flag is used to switch an existing client spec's view without
		/// <br/> 	invoking the editor.  It can be used with -S to switch to a stream
		/// <br/> 	view, or with -t to switch to a view defined in another client spec.
		/// <br/> 	Switching views is not allowed in a client that has opened files.
		/// <br/> 	The -f flag can be used with -s to force switching with opened files.
		/// <br/> 	View switching has no effect on files in a client workspace until
		/// <br/> 	'p4 sync' is run.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	Without -s, the '-S stream' flag can be used to create a new client
		/// <br/> 	spec dedicated to a stream. If the client spec already exists, and
		/// <br/> 	-S is used without -s, an error occurs when the client is bound to
		/// <br/> 	a different, or no stream.  Using -S sets the new client's
		/// <br/> 	Stream field.  The special syntax '-S //a/stream@changelist' can
		/// <br/> 	be used to set both Stream and StreamAtChange at the same time.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The '-S stream' flag can be used with '-o -c change' to inspect an
		/// <br/> 	old stream client view. It yields the client spec that would have
		/// <br/> 	been created for the stream at the moment the change was recorded.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	A server of type 'build-server' (see 'p4 help server') is a replica
		/// <br/> 	which supports build farm integration, and the 'p4 client' command
		/// <br/> 	may be used to create or edit client workspaces on a build-server.
		/// <br/> 	Such workspaces may issue the 'p4 sync' command, in addition to any
		/// <br/> 	read-only command supported by the replica. For more information, run
		/// <br/> 	'p4 help buildserver'.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	When creating or editing a client workspace for a build-server,
		/// <br/> 	the client specified by the optional 'name' argument, as well as the
		/// <br/> 	client specified by the $P4CLIENT environment variable or via the
		/// <br/> 	global '-c client' argument must not exist, or must be restricted

		/// <br/> 	View:        Maps files in the depot to files in your client
		/// <br/> 		     workspace.  Defines the files that you want in your
		/// <br/> 		     client workspace and specifies where you want them
		/// <br/> 		     to reside.  The default view maps all depot files
		/// <br/> 		     onto the client.  See 'p4 help views' for view syntax.
		/// <br/> 		     A new view takes effect on the next 'p4 sync'.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	ChangeView:  Restricts depot paths to a particular point in time.
		/// <br/> 	             Example: //depot/path/...@1000
		/// <br/> 	             Revisions submitted to the path after the specified

		/// <br/> 		     (Files in stream paths can be submitted only by dedicated
		/// <br/> 		     stream clients.) When this optional field is set, the
		/// <br/> 		     View field will be automatically replaced by a stream
		/// <br/> 		     view as the client spec is saved.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	StreamAtChange:
		/// <br/> 		     Stream meta-data (for view creation) is versioned.
		/// <br/> 		     When StreamAtChange is set, the stream hierarchy is
		/// <br/> 		     constructed back-in-time to reproduce the view that was
		/// <br/> 		     available to clients in the past. With this field set
		/// <br/> 		     changes cannot be be submitted from the client.
		/// <br/> 		     StreamAtChange is optional; Stream must be set as well.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	ServerID:    If set, restricts usage to the named server.
		/// <br/> 		     If unset, usage is allowed on the master server and on
		/// <br/> 		     any replicas of the master other than Edge Servers.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	Note: changing the client root does not actually move the client
		/// <br/> 	files; you must relocate them manually.  Similarly, changing
		/// <br/> 	the 'LineEnd' option does not actually update the client files;
		/// <br/> 	you can refresh them with 'p4 sync -f'.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -d flag deletes the specified spec, as long as the client
		/// <br/> 	workspace has no opened files or pending changes.  (See 'p4 help
		/// <br/> 	opened'.) The -f flag forces the delete. The -Fs option used with -f
		/// <br/> 	forces client deletion even when the user has shelved changes. In
		/// <br/> 	this case, the shelved changes are left intact.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -o flag writes the named client spec to the standard output.
		/// <br/> 	The user's editor is not invoked.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -i flag reads a client spec from the standard input.  The
		/// <br/> 	user's editor is not invoked.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -t template flag, where 'template' is the name of another client
		/// <br/> 	spec, causes the View and Options fields to be replaced by those of
		/// <br/> 	the template.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -f flag can force the updating of locked clients; normally
		/// <br/> 	locked clients can only be modified by their owner.  -f also allows
		/// <br/> 	the last modified date to be set.  The -f flag requires 'admin'
		/// <br/> 	access granted by 'p4 protect'.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -s flag is used to switch an existing client spec's view without
		/// <br/> 	invoking the editor.  It can be used with -S to switch to a stream
		/// <br/> 	view, or with -t to switch to a view defined in another client spec.
		/// <br/> 	Switching views is not allowed in a client that has opened files.
		/// <br/> 	The -f flag can be used with -s to force switching with opened files.
		/// <br/> 	View switching has no effect on files in a client workspace until
		/// <br/> 	'p4 sync' is run.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	Without -s, the '-S stream' flag can be used to create a new client
		/// <br/> 	spec dedicated to a stream. If the client spec already exists, and
		/// <br/> 	-S is used without -s, an error occurs when the client is bound to
		/// <br/> 	a different, or no stream.  Using -S sets the new client's
		/// <br/> 	Stream field.  The special syntax '-S //a/stream@changelist' can
		/// <br/> 	be used to set both Stream and StreamAtChange at the same time.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The '-S stream' flag can be used with '-o -c change' to inspect an
		/// <br/> 	old stream client view. It yields the client spec that would have
		/// <br/> 	been created for the stream at the moment the change was recorded.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	A server of type 'build-server' (see 'p4 help server') is a replica
		/// <br/> 	which supports build farm integration, and the 'p4 client' command
		/// <br/> 	may be used to create or edit client workspaces on a build-server.
		/// <br/> 	Such workspaces may issue the 'p4 sync' command, in addition to any
		/// <br/> 	read-only command supported by the replica. For more information, run
		/// <br/> 	'p4 help buildserver'.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	When creating or editing a client workspace for a build-server,
		/// <br/> 	the client specified by the optional 'name' argument, as well as the
		/// <br/> 	client specified by the $P4CLIENT environment variable or via the
		/// <br/> 	global '-c client' argument must not exist, or must be restricted
		/// <br/> 	to this server; this command may not be used to create or edit a
		/// <br/> 	workspace that is not restricted to this build-server.

		/// <br/> 	for each individual file argument. However, the file argument syntax
		/// <br/> 	is strict and the command will not run if an error is encountered.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -T fields flag returns only the specified fields. The field names
		/// <br/> 	can be specified using a comma- or space-delimited list.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	        Example: -Ol -T "depotFile, fileSize"

		/// <br/> 	The -m max flag limits output to the specified number of files.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -r flag sorts the output in reverse order.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -c changelist# flag displays files modified by the specified
		/// <br/> 	changelist or after that changelist was submitted.  This operation is
		/// <br/> 	much faster than using a revision range on the affected files.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -e changelist# flag lists files modified by the specified
		/// <br/> 	changelist. When used with the -Ro flag, only pending changes are
		/// <br/> 	considered, to ensure that files opened for add are included. This
		/// <br/> 	option also displays the change description.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -O options modify the output as follows:
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	        -Oa     output attributes set by 'p4 attribute'.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	        -Od     output the digest of the attribute.
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	        -Oe     output attribute values encoded as hex
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	        -Of     output all revisions for the given files (this
		/// <br/> 	                option suppresses other* and resolve* fields)
		/// <br/>

		/// <br/> 	                (this may be expensive to compute)
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	        -Op     output the local file path in both Perforce syntax
		/// <br/> 	                (//client/) as 'clientFile' and host form as 'path'
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	        -Or     output pending integration record information for
		/// <br/> 	                files opened on the current client, or if used with
		/// <br/> 	                '-e &lt;change&gt; -Rs', on the shelved change
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	        -Os     exclude client-related data from output
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -R option limits output to specific files:
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	        -Rc     files mapped in the client view
		/// <br/> 	        -Rh     files synced to the client workspace

		/// <br/> 	        -Rs     files shelved (requires -e)
		/// <br/> 	        -Ru     files opened that need resolving
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	The -S option changes the order of output:
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	        -St     sort by filetype
		/// <br/> 	        -Sd     sort by date

		/// <br/> 	depot (see 'p4 help unload').
		/// <br/> 
		/// <br/> 	For compatibility, the following flags are also supported:
