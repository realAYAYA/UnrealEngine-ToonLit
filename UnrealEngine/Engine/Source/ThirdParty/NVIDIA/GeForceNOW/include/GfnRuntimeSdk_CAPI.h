/// @mainpage Native Runtime API Reference
///
/// @section introduction Introduction
/// The NVIDIA GFN Runtime SDK provides a set of interfaces to allow game developers and game
/// publishers to interact with parts of the NVIDIA GeForce NOW ecosystem. Integration is provided
/// by various means, from native C interfaces to RESTful Web API calls, depending on the feature
/// of the SDK.
///
/// @image html ecosystem.png
///
/// This document provides details of how to integrate the native APIs of GFN Runtime SDK features
/// into your application and its developer and deployment processes.
///
/// @section overview Overview
///
/// The GFN Runtime SDK provides a dynamic library with API exports as defined in this document,
/// which is distributed with and loaded by the game/application that utilizes the APIs. The loading
/// of this library should be done in a way that validates the authenticity of the binary via checking
/// for a valid digital signature, and that signature is from NVIDIA Corporation.
///
/// The behavior of the APIs depends on the environment the application is running in; either on a
/// client/user system or in the GeForce NOW (GFN) cloud environment. Each API defines which of the
/// environments it is designed to run in.
///
/// On client systems, this library checks for the presence of the GeForce NOW (GFN) client
/// installation when any of the gfnStartStream API variants is called. If the client is not present,
/// then the library will initiate a download and installation of the latest GFN client, presenting UI
/// to the user for the download and installation process. If the GFN client is present, but out of date,
/// then a similar download and install process to update the client will take place before the
/// streaming session will start.
///
/// Once the GFN client is installed, all API actions are deferred to the GFN client. This design allows
/// the dynamic library to stay as thin as possible in the application, and provides backward and forward
/// compatibility to new GFN client packages.
///
/// Many of the APIs are no-ops depending on the environment they apply to only to either local client or
/// GFN cloud environments. In those cases, API calls will return a well-defined error code to denote the
/// call was not applicable to the environment.
///
/// Some of the APIs are used solely for authentication purposes in Account Linking and 
/// Single Sign-On scenarios. For more information about NVIDIA's Account Linking and Single Sign-On
/// model, please refer to the SDK-GFN-ACCOUNT-LINKING-SSO-GUIDE.pdf document in the /doc folder.
///
/// For additional high-level overview, please refer to the SDK primer available as part of the
/// documentation section of the SDK's repository.
///
/// @section keyconcepts Key Concepts
///
/// GFN Runtime API methods are used to make requests from or to notify the GFN
/// backend.
///
/// When your application is operating outside of the GFN environment, these
/// methods are simple stubs that incur almost no cost, so it's safe to add
/// these to your main build.
///
/// The calling convention differs by which API you've selected to use. In most
/// cases, the methods return a GfnRuntimeError result, which can be used by the
/// application to check for errors. In addition, some methods are asynchronous
/// by nature, but provide synchronous variants when possible.
