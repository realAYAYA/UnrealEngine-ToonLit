We are not distributing NVIDIA source code, binaries, or software. 
We are shipping a custom Epic built binary (called NVMLWrapper) that "assumes" you have the NVML binaries installed on your machine in the common locations and if they
are found it will attempt to load them at runtime and call specific functions in those binaries.

If the binaries are not found this module will gracefully fail with an error message in the log output.

This approach was chosen because NVIDIA's EULA around distributing nvml.h is unclear and legally ambiguous at the time of writing (6th Nov 2023).

Note: The source code for NVMLWrapper can be found in: Engine\Restricted\NotForLicensees\Source\Programs\NvmlWrapper
