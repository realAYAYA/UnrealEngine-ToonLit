Current version 4.2

To update or to add new platform download the project from the website.
Modify the root CMakeList.txt file. We want it to use third party libs from the engine for zlib and turbojpeg (libJPEG).  
Example. Replace these sections in the file with those below (for windows with libtiff 4.2)

#Zlib
set(ZLIB_FOUND TRUE)
set(ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIRS D:/dev/UE5/Engine/Source/ThirdParty/zlib/v1.2.8/include/Win64/VS2015)
set(ZLIB_LIBRARIES D:/dev/UE5/Engine/Source/ThirdParty/zlib/v1.2.8/lib/Win64-llvm/Release/zlibstatic.lib)
if(ZLIB_FOUND)
  set(ZLIB_SUPPORT 1)
endif()
set(ZIP_SUPPORT ${ZLIB_SUPPORT})

# JPEG
option(jpeg "use libjpeg (required for JPEG compression)" ON)
if (jpeg)
  set(JPEG_FOUND TRUE)
  set(JPEG_INCLUDE_DIR D:/dev/UE5/Engine/Source/ThirdParty/libjpeg-turbo/include)
  set(JPEG_LIBRARIES D:/dev/UE5/Engine/Source/ThirdParty/libjpeg-turbo/lib/Win64/turbojpeg-static.lib)
endif()
set(JPEG_SUPPORT FALSE)
if(JPEG_FOUND)
  set(JPEG_SUPPORT TRUE)
endif()


After that, set all the optional feature(options) to be on (Those that require any other third party will be turned off automatically).
Set the build shared libraries to false.
Build the lib in release.
Update the headers if needed.

Note on mac the engine doesn't have a turbo jpeg lib yet so It doesn't support jpeg compression.
Make sure to build the lib for both arm and intel (CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES should be x86_64;arm64)
And the current deployment target for OSX is 10.15.

Update these notes if needed.
