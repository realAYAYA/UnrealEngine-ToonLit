	// Problem:
	// We need to be able to work out if a path if a directory or not as some source 
	// control implementations will need to append wildcards to the path if it is
	// a directory in order for it to function correctly.
	// 
	// Strictly speaking the only way we can tell the difference between a file path
	// and a directory path is to check with the file system. 
	// However some source control implementations let us reference files on the server
	// and do not require us to have them on the users machine. This means checking with
	// the file system does not give an accurate result and can end up being very 
	// slow if the file system interprets the path as a UNC path and tries to resolve it.
	//
	// Ideally we would let the caller clearly mark if the path is for a file or a 
	// directory but this would require a large overhaul of the source control API.
	// We cannot change the existing behavior as it is very likely that 3rd party code is
	// relying on it.
	//
	// Solution:
	// As a 'temporary' solution, the caller can set bSetRequireDirPathEndWithSeparator
	// to true. When it is true we will assume that all directory paths end with a 
	// separator. Although we tend to not terminate directory paths with a separator in the 
	// engine, this will allow us an opt in to the new behavior until more substantial API
	// changes can be made.
