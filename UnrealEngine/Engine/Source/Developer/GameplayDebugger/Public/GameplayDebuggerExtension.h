// GAMEPLAY DEBUGGER EXTENSION
// 
// Extensions allows creating additional key bindings for gameplay debugger.
// For example, you can use them to add another way of selecting actor to Debug.
//
// Replication is limited only to handling input events and tool state events,
// it's not possible to send variables or RPC calls
//
// It should be compiled and used only when module is included, so every extension class
// needs be placed in #if WITH_GAMEPLAY_DEBUGGER block.
// 
// Extensions needs to be manually registered and unregistered with GameplayDebugger.
// It's best to do it in owning module's Startup / Shutdown, similar to detail view customizations.
