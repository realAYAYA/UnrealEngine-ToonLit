WebTests
--------------------

This is a collection of tests for web features like http, websocket, ssl etc.

# Running the Tests

## Run the WebServer(NOTE: This WebServer is created for TEST PURPOSE ONLY, it's not production ready!!!):
	In ./WebServer folder:
		> runserver.bat
	Or if you use docker:
		> dockerbuildandrun.bat

## Run the tests from VS:
	Set `WebTests` as the startup project and set Solution Configuration to a `Development`.
	If running tests on other devices, pass in the ip as command line args, after extra args AT THE END, like: "--extra-args --web_server_ip=your.pc.ip.address"
	Compile and debug

# Adding new test case in WebServer:
	Add/change the code in ./WebServer code, most likely in httptests/urls.py and httptests/views.py, and save. Code will be reloaded if the web server is running
	When using docker, also need to run dockerbuildandrun.bat
