/**
 * An ability state is simply an ability task that provides a way to handle the ability being interrupted.
 * You can use ability states to do state-specific cleanup if the ability ends or was interrupted at a certain point during it's execution.
 *
 * An ability state will always result in either 'OnStateEnded' or 'OnStateInterrupted' being called.
 *
 * 'OnStateEnded' will be called if:
 * - The ability itself ends via AGameplayAbility::EndAbility
 * - The ability state is manually ended via AGameplayAbility::EndAbilityState
 * - Another ability state is started will 'bEndCurrentState' set to true
 *
 * 'OnStateInterrupted' will be called if:
 * - The ability itself is cancelled via AGameplayAbility::CancelAbility
