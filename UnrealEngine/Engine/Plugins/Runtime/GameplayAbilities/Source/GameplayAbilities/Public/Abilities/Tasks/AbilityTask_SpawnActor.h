/**
 *	Convenience task for spawning actors on the network authority. If not the net authority, we will not spawn and Success will not be called.
 *	The nice thing this adds is the ability to modify expose on spawn properties while also implicitly checking network role before spawning.
 *	
 *	Though this task doesn't do much - games can implement similiar tasks that carry out game specific rules. For example a 'SpawnProjectile'
 *	task that limits the available classes to the games projectile class, and that does game specific stuff on spawn (for example, determining
 *	firing position from a weapon attachment - logic that we don't necessarily want in ability blueprints).
 *	
 *	Long term we can also use this task as a sync point. If the executing client could wait execution until the server creates and replicates the 
 *	actor down to it. We could potentially also use this to do predictive actor spawning / reconciliation.
