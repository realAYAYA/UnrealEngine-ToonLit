	 * @param bStopWhenAbilityEnds If true, this montage will be aborted if the ability ends normally. It is always stopped when the ability is explicitly cancelled

	 * @param bAllowInterruptAfterBlendOut If true, you can receive OnInterrupted after an OnBlendOut started (otherwise OnInterrupted will not fire when interrupted, but you will not get OnComplete).
