/**
 * Gameplay Effect Component (aka GEComponent)
 * 
 * GEComponents are what define how a GameplayEffect behaves.  Introduced in UE 5.3, there are very few calls from UGameplayEffect to UGameplayEffectComponent by design.
 * Instead of providing a larger API for all desired functionality, the implementer of a GEComponent must read the GE flow carefully and register desired callbacks
 * to achieve the desired results.  This effectively limits the implementation of GEComponents to native code for the time being.
 * 
 * GEComponents live Within a GameplayEffect (which is typically a data-only blueprint asset).  Thus, like GEs, only one GEComponent exists for all applied instances.
 * One of the unintuitive caveats of this is that GEComponent should not contain any runtime manipulated/instanced data (e.g. stored state per execution).
 * One must take careful consideration about where to store any data (and thus when it can be evaluated).  The early implementations typically work around this by
 * storing small amounts of runtime data on the desired callbacks (e.g. by binding extra parameters on the delegate).  This may explain why some functionality is still
 * in UGameplayEffect rather than a UGameplayEffectComponent.  Future implementations may need extra data stored on the FGameplayEffectSpec (i.e. Gameplay Effect Spec Components).
 * 
 * @see GameplayEffect.h for further notes, especially on the terminology used (Added vs. Executed vs. Apply).
