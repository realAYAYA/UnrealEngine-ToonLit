/**
 * This file has the implementation of the Gameplay Ability Audit code.  You can right-click on assets and select "Audit" which will produce a DataTable with useful information.
 * The trick to do a full audit is to select all of the GameplayAbility Blueprints in the Content Browser (use filter 'NativeParentClass=GameplayAbility'), then right-click and select the Audit Context Menu Item
 * 
 * You can extend this functionality in your own project in two simple steps:
 *	Step 1: Derive your own audit Data Table Row from FGameplayAbilityAuditRow.
 *  Step 2: Override FillDataFromGameplayAbilityBlueprint in your derived class for any Blueprint code (e.g. node / flow inspection).
 *  Step 3: Override FillDataFromGameplayAbility in your derived class for any data/variable inspection (e.g. you've made your own UGameplayAbility-derived type).
 * 
 * Some magic in the namespace MenuExtension_GameplayAbilityBlueprintAudit should pick up your derived class and use it (assuming one derived row type per project).
