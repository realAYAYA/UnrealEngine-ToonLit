/**
 * Transfer bone weights from one mesh (source) to another (target). Uses the dynamic mesh bone attributes to reindex
 * the bone indices of the transferred weights from the source to the target skeletons. If both meshes have identical
 * bone name attributes, then reindexing is skipped.
 *
 * During the reindexing, if a weighted bone in the source skeleton is not present in the target skeleton, then the
 * weight is not transferred (skipped), and an error is printed to the console. For best results, the target skeleton
 * should be a superset of all the bones that are indexed by the transferred weights.
 *
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * FDynamicMesh SourceMesh = ...; // Mesh we transferring weights from. Must have bone attributes.
 * FDynamicMesh TargetMesh = ...; // Mesh we are transferring weights to.
 *
 * FTransferBoneWeights TransferBoneWeights(&SourceMesh, FSkeletalMeshAttributes::DefaultSkinWeightProfileName);
 *
 * // Optionally, transform the target mesh. This is useful when you want to align the two meshes in world space.
 * TransferBoneWeights.TargetToWorld = ...;
 *
 * // When transferring weights from a dynamic mesh with bone attributes to a dynamic mesh without bone attributes,
 * // first copy over the bone attributes from the source to the target.
 * if (!TargetMesh.HasAttributes() || !TargetMesh.Attributes()->HasBones())
 * {
 *     TargetMesh.EnableAttributes();
 *     TargetMesh.Attributes()->CopyBoneAttributes(*SourceMesh.Attributes());
 * }
 *
 * // Set the transfer method.
 * TransferBoneWeights.TransferMethod = ETransferBoneWeightsMethod::...;
 *
 * // if ETransferBoneWeightsMethod::ClosestPointOnSurface is used and you simply want to copy weights over from the
 * // closest points then set the radius and normal threshold to -1 (default).
 * TransferBoneWeights.SearchRadius = -1
 * TransferBoneWeights.NormalThreshold = -1
 *
 * // if ETransferBoneWeightsMethod::InpaintWeights is used then additionally set the radius and normal parameters
 * TransferBoneWeights.SearchRadius = ...    // Good estimate is to use a small value (0.05) of the bounding box radius
 * TransferBoneWeights.NormalThreshold = ... // 30 degrees (0.52 rad) works well in practice
 *
 * if (TransferBoneWeights.Validate() == EOperationValidationResult::Ok)
 * {
 *      TransferBoneWeights.TransferWeightsToMesh(TargetMesh, FSkeletalMeshAttributes::DefaultSkinWeightProfileName);
 * }
 *
 * // Alternatively if you don't want to use FDynamicMesh3 to represent your target mesh you can transfer weights to
 * // to each point separately by calling
 * if (TransferBoneWeights.Validate() == EOperationValidationResult::Ok)
 * {
 *      for each Point:
 *          FBoneWeights Weights;
 *          TransferBoneWeights.TransferWeightsToPoint(Weights, Point);
 * }
 *
 * // After the transfer you can check which target mesh vertices had the weight transferred directly from the source mesh
 * // via the FTransferBoneWeights:MatchedVertices array
