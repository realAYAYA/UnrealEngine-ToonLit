Added support for building for arm64 macs. Currently vpx assumes arm64-darwin 
is iPhoneOS so now follow the convention it uses for x86_64 where darwinNN
specifies the macos version.

E.g. arm64-darwin-gcc remains iOS and arm64-darwin13-gcc is macos

'configure' has been updated to recognize arm64-darwinxx-gcc targets
'build/make/configure.sh' has been updated to differntiate between 'darwin'
and 'darwinxx' where necessary (primarily when adding SDK paths)
