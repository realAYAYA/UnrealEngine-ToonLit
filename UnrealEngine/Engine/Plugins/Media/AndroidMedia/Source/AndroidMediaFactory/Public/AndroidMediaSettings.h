	 * Engine. In such applications, the video samples transfer their contents
	 * via a frame buffer. By default, the same frame buffer is reused for every
	 * sample to avoid buffer copies. Every time a new sample is generated, the
	 * previously generated samples are invalidated.
	 *
	 * When enabling this option, video frame buffers are copied into instead of
	 * referenced in video samples. This may be useful for applications that require
	 * access to individual frames, but it may dramatically decrease performance.
	 *
	 * When compiling against the Engine, this setting has no effect as the frame
	 * data is transferred via separate texture resource objects.
