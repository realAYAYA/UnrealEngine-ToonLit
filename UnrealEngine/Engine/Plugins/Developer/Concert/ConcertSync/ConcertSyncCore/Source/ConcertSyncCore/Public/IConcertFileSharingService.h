/**
 * Implements a file sharing service used as a side channel to ConcertTransport to exchange large files. This API is designed to
 * work hand in hand with the request/response/event layer.
 *
 * When a file needs to be exchanged between the client and the server:
 *
 * The publisher side would:
 *    - Publish a file using file sharing service. The service tracks the request and capture the file for sharing (can sent it to a server asynchronously, can be copied to a shared folder, etc.)
 *    - Notify the consumer(s) by sending a Concert request/event/response with the ID of the published file.
 *
 * The consumer(s) side would:
 *    - Receive and process the Concert request/event/response and extract the file ID.
 *    - Create a stream to read the shared file, ideally in a background task. If required, new method could be added to simplify asynchrous IO.
 *
 * * @note The lifetime of the shared files is implementation specific.
 *
