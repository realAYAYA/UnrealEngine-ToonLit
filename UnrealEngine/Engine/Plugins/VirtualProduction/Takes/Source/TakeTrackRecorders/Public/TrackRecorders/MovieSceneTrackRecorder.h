	* is not passed in. Instead Track recorders should implement SetSectionStartTimecodeImpl which will be called when StartRecording is called. StartRecording is called one after 
	* another and should be a non-blocking operation which will ensure all sources will start on the most up to date and in-sync timecode data.
