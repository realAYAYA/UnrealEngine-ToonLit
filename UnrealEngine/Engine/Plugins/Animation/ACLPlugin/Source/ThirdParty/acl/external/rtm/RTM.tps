  <Function>Realtime Math (RTM) is an open source math library for game development. It is highly optimized for mainstream platforms (ARM and x64) and it offers a wide range of features.
  The library is implemented in C++11 with the help of CMake and python for build scripts.   the code is neither statically nor dynamically linked as they do not provide any binaries to link against. 
  Now we'll be integrating the plugin into the engine itself with the goal of distributing it out of the box with the engine.
