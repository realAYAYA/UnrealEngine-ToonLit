/**
 * The neural morph model.
 * This generates a set of highly compressed morph targets to approximate a target deformation based on bone rotations and/or curve inputs.
 * During inference, the neural network inside this model runs on the CPU and outputs the morph target weights for the morph targets it generated during training.
 * Groups of bones and curves can also be defined. Those groups will generate a set of morph targets together as well. This can help when shapes depend on multiple inputs.
 * An external morph target set is generated during training and serialized inside the ML Deformer asset that contains this model.
 * When the ML Deformer component initializes the morph target set is registered. Most of the heavy lifting is done by the UMLDeformerMorphModel class.
 * The neural morph model has two modes: local and global. See the ENeuralMorphMode for a description of the two.
 * @see ENeuralMorphMode
