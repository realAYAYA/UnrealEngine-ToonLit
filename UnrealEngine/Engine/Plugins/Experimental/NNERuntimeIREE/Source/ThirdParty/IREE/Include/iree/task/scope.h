// iree_task_scope_t is an atomic reference-counting helper posting a
// notification when the reference count is decremended to 0.
//
// It is used as a loose way of grouping tasks within the task system.
// Each scope represents a unique collection of tasks that have some related
// properties - most often their producer - that need to carry along some
// tracking information to act on all related tasks at once. They do not
// indicate any particular ordering of tasks or how the tasks are to be treated
// by executors.
//
// Scopes can be used to signal, propagate, and retrieve failure statuses. As
// the executor processes tasks in an unordered fashion this is the only way to
// perform cross-task operations such as "abort all of the tasks from this
// producer" or "wait until all tasks from this producer finish." In addition
// there are statistics that can be aggregated across all tasks attributed to
// the scope that allows for an efficient roll-up of activity over specific
// durations.
//
// Task producers can decide whether to create new scopes for each batch of
// tasks they submit or reuse scopes for the lifetime of their subprocess. Scope
// overhead is low and the only advantage of reusing them is that lifetime can
// become easier to manage by tying them 1:1 with producers.
//
// Thread-safe; once created scopes are modified exclusively via atomic
// operations.
