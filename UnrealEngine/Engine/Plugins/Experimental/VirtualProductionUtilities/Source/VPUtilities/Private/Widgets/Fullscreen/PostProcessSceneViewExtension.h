	 * squeeze != 1, the cine camera will smallen the viewport vertically (adding black bars to the top and bottom) and render the blend material.
	 * This method will render the post process material over the entire area of the viewport (over the black bars as well).

	 * Intended to be used with a post process material that renders a widget over the viewport, e.g. useful for pixel streaming.
