# BackChannel

BackChannel is an experimetal plugin that allows external tools and apps to query for and push data into a running Unreal session.

The goal is to support 2-3 ubiquitous protocols where implementations can be easily created or found for popular languages. The short term focus is OSC over TCP/IP and JSON REST over HTTP.
