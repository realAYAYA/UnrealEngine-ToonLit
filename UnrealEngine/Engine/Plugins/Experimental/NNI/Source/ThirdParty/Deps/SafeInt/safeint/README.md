# SafeInt
SafeInt is a class library for C++ that manages integer overflows.

Now updated to keep the entire history of the class from the time it first was checked into CodePlex. 

March, 2018 - added support for constexpr, also enforcing a requirement that --std=c++11 or --std=c++14
has to be used for gcc or clang, minimum Visual Studio compiler version TBD.
