Description: This is a procedurally generated markdown page.
Version: 5.3

### Read-Only Properties

$ Platform (UnrealTargetPlatform): Platform that this target is being built for.

$ Configuration (UnrealTargetConfiguration): The configuration being built.

$ Architectures (UnrealArchitectures): Architecture that the target is being built for (or an empty string for the default).

$ ProjectFile (FileReference): Path to the project file for the project containing this target.

$ Version (ReadOnlyBuildVersion): The current build version

$ OriginalName (String): Return the original target name without overrides or adornments

$ IsTestTarget (Boolean): Whether this is a low level tests target.

$ ExplicitTestsTarget (Boolean): Whether this is a test target explicitly defined. Explicitley defined test targets always inherit from TestTargetRules and define their own tests. Implicit test targets are created from existing targets when building with -Mode=Test and they include tests from all dependencies.

$ WithLowLevelTests (Boolean): Controls the value of WITH_LOW_LEVEL_TESTS that dictates whether module-specific low level tests are compiled in or not.

$ Architecture (UnrealArch): Gets the Architecture in the normal case where there is a single Architecture in Architectures (this will throw an exception if there is more than one architecture specified)

$ bIWYU (Boolean): Enables "include what you use" by default for modules in this target. Changes the default PCH mode for any module in this project to PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs.

$ HostPlatform (UnrealTargetPlatform): Gets the host platform being built on

$ bGenerateProjectFiles (Boolean): Expose the bGenerateProjectFiles flag to targets, so we can modify behavior as appropriate for better intellisense

$ bShouldTargetRulesTogglePlugins (Boolean): Indicates whether target rules should be used to explicitly enable or disable plugins. Usually not needed for project generation unless project files indicate whether referenced plugins should be built or not.

$ bIsEngineInstalled (Boolean): Expose a setting for whether or not the engine is installed


### Read/Write Properties
$ IntermediateEnvironment (UnrealIntermediateEnvironment): Intermediate environment. Determines if the intermediates end up in a different folder than normal.

$ Type (TargetType): The type of target.

$ ForcedIncludeOrder (Nullable&lt;EngineIncludeOrderVersion&gt;): Force the include order to a specific version. Overrides any Target and Module rules.

$ OutputFile (String): Path to the output file for the main executable, relative to the Engine or project directory. This setting is only typically useful for non-UE programs, since the engine uses paths relative to the executable to find other known folders (eg. Content).

$ bUsesSteam (Boolean): Whether the target uses Steam.

$ bUsesCEF3 (Boolean): Whether the target uses CEF3.

$ bUsesSlate (Boolean): Whether the project uses visual Slate UI (as opposed to the low level windowing/messaging, which is always available).

$ bUseStaticCRT (Boolean): Forces linking against the static CRT. This is not fully supported across the engine due to the need for allocator implementations to be shared (for example), and TPS libraries to be consistent with each other, but can be used for utility programs.

$ bDebugBuildsActuallyUseDebugCRT (Boolean): Enables the debug C++ runtime (CRT) for debug builds. By default we always use the release runtime, since the debug version isn't particularly useful when debugging Unreal Engine projects, and linking against the debug CRT libraries forces our third party library dependencies to also be compiled using the debug CRT (and often perform more slowly). Often it can be inconvenient to require a separate copy of the debug versions of third party static libraries simply so that you can debug your program's code.

This allows referencing non-optional plugin modules which cannot be disabled, and allows building against specific modules in program targets which do not fit the categories in ModuleHostType.

$ EnablePlugins (List&lt;String&gt;): Additional plugins that should be included for this target.

$ DisablePlugins (List&lt;String&gt;): List of plugins to be disabled for this target. Note that the project file may still reference them, so they should be marked as optional to avoid failing to find them at runtime.

$ DisablePluginsConflictWarningLevel (WarningLevel): How to treat conflicts when a disabled plugin is being enabled by another plugin referencing it

$ InternalPluginDependencies (List&lt;String&gt;): A list of Plugin names that are allowed to exist as dependencies without being defined in the uplugin descriptor

$ bHeadersOnly (Boolean): When used with -IncludeHeaders, only header files will be compiled.

$ bForcePrecompiledHeaderForGameModules (Boolean): When enabled, a precompiled header is always generated for game modules, even if there are only a few source files in the module.  This greatly improves compile times for iterative changes on a few files in the project, at the expense of slower full rebuild times for small game projects.  This can be overridden by setting MinFilesUsingPrecompiledHeaderOverride in a module's Build.cs file.

$ bUseIncrementalLinking (Boolean): Whether to use incremental linking or not. Incremental linking can yield faster iteration times when making small changes. Currently disabled by default because it tends to behave a bit buggy on some computers (PDB-related compile errors).

Specify DefaultSettingsVersion.Latest to always use defaults for the current engine version, at the risk of introducing build errors while upgrading.
