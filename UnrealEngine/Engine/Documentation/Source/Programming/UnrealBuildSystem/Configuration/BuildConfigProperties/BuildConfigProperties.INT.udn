### BuildConfiguration

$ bIgnoreOutdatedImportLibraries : Whether to ignore import library files that are out of date when building targets. Set this to true to improve iteration time. By default, we do not bother re-linking targets if only a dependent .lib has changed, as chances are that the import library was not actually different unless a dependent header file of this target was also changed, in which case the target would automatically be rebuilt.

$ bPrintDebugInfo : Whether debug info should be written to the console.

$ bAllowHybridExecutor : Whether the hybrid executor will be used (a remote executor and local executor). No longer supported.

$ RemoteExecutorPriority : Priority order for remote executors (XGE, SNDBS, FASTBuild, UBA)

$ bAllowUBAExecutor : Whether the UnrealBuildAccelerator executor will be used.

$ bAllowUBALocalExecutor : Whether the UnrealBuildAccelerator (local only) executor will be used.

$ bAllowXGE : Whether XGE may be used if available, default is true.

$ bAllowFASTBuild : Whether FASTBuild may be used if available, default is true.

$ bAllowSNDBS : Whether SN-DBS may be used if available, default is true.

$ bUseUBTMakefiles : Enables support for very fast iterative builds by caching target data. Turning this on causes Unreal Build Tool to emit 'UBT Makefiles' for targets when they are built the first time. Subsequent builds will load these Makefiles and begin outdatedness checking and build invocation very quickly. The caveat is that if source files are added or removed to the project, UBT will need to gather information about those in order for your build to complete successfully. Currently, you must run the project file generator after adding/removing source files to tell UBT to re-gather this information. 
    * Events that can invalidate the 'UBT Makefile':
        * Adding/removing .cpp files
        * Adding/removing .h files with UObjects
        * Adding new UObject types to a file that did not previously have any
        * Changing global build settings (most settings in this file qualify)
        * Changed code that affects how Unreal Header Tool works 
    * You can force regeneration of the 'UBT Makefile' by passing the '-gather' argument, or simply regenerating project files. 
    * This also enables the fast include file dependency scanning and caching system that allows Unreal Build Tool to detect out of date dependencies very quickly. When enabled, a deep C++ include graph does not have to be generated, and instead, we only scan and cache indirect includes for after a dependent build product was already found to be out of date. During the next build, we will load those cached indirect includes and check for outdatedness.

$ MaxParallelActions : Number of actions that can be executed in parallel. If 0 then code will pick a default based on the number of cores and memory available. Applies to the ParallelExecutor, HybridExecutor, and LocalExecutor

$ bAllCores : Consider logical cores when determining how many total cpu cores are available.

$ bCompactOutput : Instruct the executor to write compact output e.g. only errors, if supported by the executor. This field is used to hold the value when specified from the command line or XML

$ bArtifactRead : If set, artifacts will be read

$ bArtifactWrites : If set, artifacts will be written

$ bLogArtifactCacheMisses : If true, log all artifact cache misses as informational messages

$ ArtifactDirectory : Location to store the artifacts.

$ bUseUnityBuild : Whether to unify C++ code into larger files for faster compilation.

$ bForceUnityBuild : Whether to force C++ source files to be combined into larger files for faster compilation.

$ DefaultWarningLevel : Default treatment of uncategorized warnings

$ DeprecationWarningLevel : Level to report deprecation warnings as errors

$ bDebugBuildsActuallyUseDebugCRT : Enables the debug C++ runtime (CRT) for debug builds. By default we always use the release runtime, since the debug version isn't particularly useful when debugging Unreal Engine projects, and linking against the debug CRT libraries forces our third party library dependencies to also be compiled using the debug CRT (and often perform more slowly). Often it can be inconvenient to require a separate copy of the debug versions of third party static libraries simply so that you can debug your program's code.

$ bLegalToDistributeBinary : Whether the output from this target can be publicly distributed, even if it has dependencies on modules that are in folders with special restrictions (eg. CarefullyRedist, NotForLicensees, NoRedist).

$ bUseVerseBPVM : Whether to use the BPVM to run Verse.

$ bUseAutoRTFMCompiler : Whether to use the AutoRTFM Clang compiler.

$ bUseInlining : Enable inlining for all modules.

$ bUseDebugLiveCodingConsole : Whether to enable support for live coding

$ bUseXGEController : Whether the XGE controller worker and modules should be included in the engine build. These are required for distributed shader compilation using the XGE interception interface.

$ bUseAdaptiveUnityBuild : Use a heuristic to determine which files are currently being iterated on and exclude them from unity blobs, result in faster incremental compile times. The current implementation uses the read-only flag to distinguish the working set, assuming that files will be made writable by the source control system if they are being modified. This is true for Perforce, but not for Git.

$ bAdaptiveUnityDisablesOptimizations : Disable optimization for files that are in the adaptive non-unity working set.

$ bAdaptiveUnityDisablesPCH : Disables force-included PCHs for files that are in the adaptive non-unity working set.

$ bAdaptiveUnityDisablesProjectPCHForProjectPrivate : Backing storage for bAdaptiveUnityDisablesProjectPCH.

$ bAdaptiveUnityCreatesDedicatedPCH : Creates a dedicated PCH for each source file in the working set, allowing faster iteration on cpp-only changes.

$ bAdaptiveUnityEnablesEditAndContinue : Creates a dedicated PCH for each source file in the working set, allowing faster iteration on cpp-only changes.

$ bAdaptiveUnityCompilesHeaderFiles : Creates a dedicated source file for each header file in the working set to detect missing includes in headers.

$ MinGameModuleSourceFilesForUnityBuild : The number of source files in a game module before unity build will be activated for that module.  This allows small game modules to have faster iterative compile times for single files, at the expense of slower full rebuild times.  This setting can be overridden by the bFasterWithoutUnity option in a module's Build.cs file.

$ bRequireObjectPtrForAddReferencedObjects : Require TObjectPtr for FReferenceCollector API's. (Needed for compatibility with incremental GC.)

$ bValidateFormatStrings : Emits compilation errors for incorrect UE_LOG format strings.

$ bWarningsAsErrors : Whether to enable all warnings as errors. UE enables most warnings as errors already, but disables a few (such as deprecation warnings).

$ UnsafeTypeCastWarningLevel : Indicates what warning/error level to treat unsafe type casts as on platforms that support it (e.g., double->float or int64->int32)

$ bUndefinedIdentifierErrors : Forces the use of undefined identifiers in conditional expressions to be treated as errors.

$ PCHPerformanceIssueWarningLevel : Indicates what warning/error level to treat potential PCH performance issues.

$ ModuleIncludePathWarningLevel : How to treat general module include path validation messages

$ ModuleIncludePrivateWarningLevel : How to treat private module include path validation messages, where a module is adding an include path that exposes private headers

$ bRetainFramePointers : Forces frame pointers to be retained this is usually required when you want reliable callstacks e.g. mallocframeprofiler

$ bUseFastMonoCalls : New Monolithic Graphics drivers have optional "fast calls" replacing various D3d functions

$ NumIncludedBytesPerUnityCPP : An approximate number of bytes of C++ code to target for inclusion in a single unified C++ file.

$ DebugInfo : How much debug info should be generated. See DebugInfoMode enum for more details

$ DebugInfoLineTablesOnly : True if only debug line number tables should be emitted in debug information for compilers that support doing so. Overrides TargetRules.DebugInfo See https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#cmdoption-gline-tables-only for more information

$ bDisableDebugInfoForGeneratedCode : Whether to disable debug info generation for generated files. This improves link times and reduces pdb size for modules that have a lot of generated glue code.

$ bOmitPCDebugInfoInDevelopment : Whether to disable debug info on PC/Mac in development builds (for faster developer iteration, as link times are extremely fast with debug info disabled).

$ bUsePDBFiles : Whether PDB files should be used for Visual C++ builds.

$ bUsePCHFiles : Whether PCH files should be used.

$ bStaticAnalyzerIncludeGenerated : When enabled, generated source files will be analyzed

$ MinFilesUsingPrecompiledHeader : The minimum number of files that must use a pre-compiled header before it will be created and used.

$ bForcePrecompiledHeaderForGameModules : When enabled, a precompiled header is always generated for game modules, even if there are only a few source files in the module.  This greatly improves compile times for iterative changes on a few files in the project, at the expense of slower full rebuild times for small game projects.  This can be overridden by setting MinFilesUsingPrecompiledHeaderOverride in a module's Build.cs file.

$ bUseIncrementalLinking : Whether to use incremental linking or not. Incremental linking can yield faster iteration times when making small changes. Currently disabled by default because it tends to behave a bit buggy on some computers (PDB-related compile errors).

$ bUseSharedPCHs : Enables "Shared PCHs", a feature which significantly speeds up compile times by attempting to share certain PCH files between modules that UBT detects is including those PCH's header files.

$ bUseShippingPhysXLibraries : True if Development and Release builds should use the release configuration of PhysX/APEX.

$ bUseCheckedPhysXLibraries : True if Development and Release builds should use the checked configuration of PhysX/APEX. if bUseShippingPhysXLibraries is true this is ignored.

$ bCreateMapFile : Outputs a map file as part of the build.

$ bAllowRuntimeSymbolFiles : True if runtime symbols files should be generated as a post build step for some platforms. These files are used by the engine to resolve symbol names of callstack backtraces in logs.
