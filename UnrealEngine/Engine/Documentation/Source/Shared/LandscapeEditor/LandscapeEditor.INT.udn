[EXCERPT:ResizeLandscape]
The **Change Component Size** Landscape tool allows you to change the size of the entire Landscape. Keep in mind that this does not work on individual components but on the entire Landscape as a whole. With this tool you can change the size of the Landscape components and adjust how many sections each component has in the Change Component Size section.

[EXCERPT:SplineTool]
The Landscape Splines tool is a flexible system for creating linear features that need to conform to the Landscape such as paths or roads. Landscape Splines can even push or pull the terrain underneath them so that the Splines will better sit on the Landscape.

[EXCERPT:SculptTool]
The Sculpt Tool allows you to raise or lower the height of the Landscape height map. To raise the height of the Landscape heightmap, use CRTL + Left Mouse Button. To lower the height of the Landscape height map, use CRTL+SHIFT+Left Mouse Button.

[EXCERPT:SmoothTool]
The Smooth tool helps to smooth the heightmap, getting rid of jagged artifacts that can sometimes arise after using the Sculpting or Erosion tools. The Smooth tool also works with Painting mode to help smooth the transitions between different Landscape materials. To use the Smoothing tool, simply hold down the CRTL key and use the Left Button of your Mouse to smooth out the area under the Brush.

[EXCERPT:FlattenTool]
The Flatten tool flattens the Landscape to the level that is currently under the mouse when you first active the tool. To use the Flatten tool, simply hold down the CRTL key and use the Left Button of your Mouse to Flatten the area under the Brush.

[EXCERPT:RampTool]
The Ramp Tool enables you to make a ramp between two points on your Landscape. You can even specify a fall off for the sides of the Ramp that determines how sharply the sides of the Ramp will falloff. To use the Ramp tool, simply hold down the CRTL key and use the Left Mouse Button to place where you want the first point to be located on the Landscape. To place the 2nd Ramp point, keep the CTRL key held down and simply click, using the Left Mouse Button, anywhere else on the Landscape. Once your Ramp points are set you can adjust their location by selecting either icon and moving them using the Gizmo. Once you are happy with the location of your Ramp, you can add the Ramp to the Landscape by using the Add Ramp Button from the Tool Settings menu. If you want to undo the Ramp, simply press the Reset Button to remove the Ramp.

[EXCERPT:ErosionTool]
The Erosion tool uses a thermal erosion simulation to adjust the height of the heightmap. This simulates the transfer of soil from higher elevations to lower elevations. The larger the difference in elevation, the more erosion will occur. This tool also applies a noise effect on top of the erosion, if desired, to provide a more natural random appearance. To use the Erosion tool, simply hold down the CRTL key and use the Left Mouse Button to apply the Erosion in the area under the Brush.

[EXCERPT:HydroErosionTool]
The Hydro Erosion tool uses a hydraulic erosion simulation, i.e. erosion from water, to adjust the height of the heightmap. A noise filter is used to determine where the initial rain is distributed. Then the simulation is calculated to determine water flow from that initial rain as well as dissolving, water transfer, and evaporation. The result of that calculation provides the actual value used to lower the heightmap. To use the Hydro Erosion tool, simply hold down the CRTL key and use the Left Mouse Button to apply the Hydro Erosion to the area under the Brush.

[EXCERPT:NoiseTool]
The Noise tool applies a noise filter to the heightmap or layer weight. The strength determines the amount of noise to apply to the heightmap or layer weight. To use the Noise tool, simply hold down the CRTL key and use the Left Mouse Button to apply the noise to the area under the Brush.
![](Noise_Types_00.png)

[EXCERPT:RetopologizeTool]
The Retopologize tool automatically adjusts Landscape vertices with an X/Y offset map to improve vertex density on cliffs, reducing texture stretching. An X/Y offset map makes the Landscape slower to render and paint on with other tools, so only use the Retopologize tool if needed. To use the Retopologize tool, simply hold down the CRTL key and use the Left Mouse Button to Retopologize the area under the Brush.

[EXCERPT:VisibilityTool]
The Visibility tool allows you to create holes in your Landscape. This is good if you would like to create a hole in your Landscape for something like a cave. To use the Visibility tool, simply hold down the CRTL key and use the Left Mouse Button to change the Visibility to the area under the Brush.

[EXCERPT:RegionSelectTool]
The Region Selection tool selects regions of the Landscape using the current brush settings and tool strength to be used to fit a Landscape gizmo to a specific area or to act as a mask for copying data to, or pasting data from, a gizmo. You can also use the Region Selection tool to mask off certain areas of the Landscape so that they are not affected when using other tools such as the Sculpt tool or the Smoothing tool. To use the Region Selection tool, simply paint the area that you want to mask by holding down CRTL and using the Left Mouse Button to paint. To remove the masked area, simply hold down CRTL + SHIFT and Left Mouse Button to erase the mask that was just painted.

[EXCERPT:RegionCopyPasteTool]
The Region Copy and Paste tool allows you to copy height data from one area of a Landscape to another through the use of Landscape Gizmos. You can also import and export Gizmo data for use in other Landcapes in other levels.

[EXCERPT:AlphaBrush]
The Alpha brush is similar to the Pattern brush, but instead of tiling the texture across the Landscape as you paint, it orients the brush texture in the direction of your painting and drags the shape as you move the cursor. You can pack multiple brush patterns in the various RGB channels of a texture. To select a different pattern simply select a different channel of the texture that is currently assigned using the Texture Channel option.

[EXCERPT:AlphaBrush_Pattern]
The Pattern brush allows you to use an arbitrary shape for the brush by sampling a single color channel from a texture to use as the alpha for the brush. The texture pattern is tiled as the brush is painted. You can pack multiple brush patterns in the various RGB channels of a texture. To select a different pattern, simply select a different channel of the texture that is currently assigned using the Texture Channel option.

[EXCERPT:PaintTool]
Paint mode enables you to modify the appearance of your Landscape by selectively applying different Material Layers to different parts of your Landscape. To apply different materials to your landscape, simply select the material you wish to paint from the Target Layers and paint by hold down the CRTL key and using the Left Mouse Button to apply the selected material to the area under the Brush. Holding CRTL + SHIFT will erase the material that was just painted. Keep in mind that you can only erase if there is another Material Layer on that texel of the Landscape. This means that areas that are 100% painted over cannot be erased and have to painted over.
