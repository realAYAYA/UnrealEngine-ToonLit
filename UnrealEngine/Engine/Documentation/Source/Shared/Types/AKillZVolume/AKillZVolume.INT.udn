Description:Overview of the KillZVolume class

[EXCERPT:AKillZVolume]

The Kill Z Volume or "Kill-Brush" essentially destroys any Actor that enters the volume (this includes the Player).  The Kill Z is the coordinate along the Z axis at which an Actor is automatically destroyed or players are killed. Setting a Kill Z helps prevent player characters from getting stuck and being unable to respawn when they fall off an edge.
