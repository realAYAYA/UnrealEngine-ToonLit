[EXCERPT:UParticleSystem]
A ParticleSystem is a complete particle effect that contains any number of ParticleEmitters. By allowing multiple emitters in a system, the designer can create elaborate particle effects that are held in a single system. Once created using Cascade, a ParticleSystem can then be inserted into a level or created in script.
