Description:Overview of the PointLight class

[EXCERPT:APointLight]

A PointLight works much like a real world light bulb, emitting light in all directions from the light bulb's tungsten filament. However, for the sake of performance, PointLights are simplified down emitting light equally in all directions from just a single point in space.
