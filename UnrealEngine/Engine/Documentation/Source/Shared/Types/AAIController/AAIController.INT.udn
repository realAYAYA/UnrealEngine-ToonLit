Description:Overview of the AIController class

[EXCERPT:AAIController]

The AIController is more focused on responding to input from the environment and game world. Whereas the PlayerController relies on the human player to make decisions on what to do and simply converts those decisions into actions within the game, while the AIController must make all of those decisions on its own by observing the world around it and reacting accordingly.
