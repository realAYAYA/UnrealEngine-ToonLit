Tips:

- Always use the fewest possible number of different font sizes in your project. This avoids wasting memory in font atlas textures.

- If text elements do not appear at the pixel size you expect, you may need to change your projectâ€™s Font Resolution setting. To find this setting, choose Edit > Project Settings from the main menu and search for Font Resolution.
