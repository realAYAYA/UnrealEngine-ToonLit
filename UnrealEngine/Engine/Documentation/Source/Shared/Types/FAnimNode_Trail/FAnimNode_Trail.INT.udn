[EXCERPT:TrailRelaxationSpeed]

### Overview

Define curve of trail relaxation speed. Trail Relaxation Speed is the speed of trail to relax to animated pose. It is not [0, 1] because it needs to be frame independent.

The x axis is ranged from 0 to 1, and it is mapped to chain of joints. The 0 value is mapped to root joint, and 1 will be mapped to bottom joint. 
If you do have chain of 10, it will evaluate interval of 9 and allocate from 0->9 joints. 

The y axis is ranged from any positive and it is speed of relaxation. What this means is how fast it goes back to animated position. 
It is absolute value to prevent frame dependency. The default value is from [10, 5], as the top part goes back faster than bottom part.
