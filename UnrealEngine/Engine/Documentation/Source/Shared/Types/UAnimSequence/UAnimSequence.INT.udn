### Overview

Animations can be used as absolute or additive at any time. The system performs the appropriate calculations to convert the data to offsets when necessary. This makes the system much more flexible than that of previous versions of the engine since you do not have to specify ahead of time that an animation is to be considered additive.

### Additive animation

The additive animation calculates the delta of base animation and current animation and you can apply that difference to any base animation. 
This allows you do create different permutation of animations by applying this delta to different base animation. 

This requires two pieces of information:

1. Current animation : This animation to be converted
2. Base animation : when you calculate delta, you need where it is based on, which changes how the delta is extracted

### Additive animation type

This decides what kind of additive you want this to use. 

1. No additive: This animation is not additive
2. Local Space: This animation is additive and delta is calculated by local space. This is most popular option of additive. This calculates different in local space, and apply that delta to local space. 
3. Mesh Space: This animation is additive and delta will be applied in component space. This is an option when you want the additive to be applied to component space. This is required for aim offset because aim offset should be applied in component space

### Base Pose Type

This decides how this additive delta to be calculated. 

1. None: No base pose
2. Reference Pose: The mesh's default reference pose. To see this, in the viewport, select show->reference pose. 
3. Selected animation scaled: Choose another animation below and scale whole animation when extract the delta
4. Selected animation frame: Choose another animation below and only based on the frame number

### Base Pose Animation

If your above option is requires selected animation, you can choose animation here. 
You only can choose animation that is compatible with current skeleton. 

If you selected "Selected animation frame", you can choose what frame count you want. The frame number is start from 0.
