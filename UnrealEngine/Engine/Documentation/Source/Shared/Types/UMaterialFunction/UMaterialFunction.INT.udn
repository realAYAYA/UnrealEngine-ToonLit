Description:Overview of the MaterialFunction class

[EXCERPT:UMaterialFunction]

Material Functions are little snippets of material graphs that can be saved in packages and reused across multiple materials. They allow complex networks to be saved out and quickly reused, while also allowing more complex networks to be abstracted into single nodes, making material creation easier for artists.
