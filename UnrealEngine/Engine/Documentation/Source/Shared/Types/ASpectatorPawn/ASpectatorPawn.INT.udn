Description:Overview of the SpectatorPawn class

[EXCERPT:ASpectatorPawn]

The SpectatorPawn class is a subclass of DefaultPawn.

Like DefaultPawn, it has a spherical CollisionComponent, although the StaticMeshComponent is not created. The movement for the SpectatorPawn class is handled in the SpectatorPawnMovementComponent; the no-gravity flying behavior is the same as in the DefaultPawnMovementComponent, with added code for handling or ignoring time dilation as necessary.
