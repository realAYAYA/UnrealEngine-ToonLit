Title:Blueprint Graph Types
Crumbs:
Description:Overview of the Blueprint Graph types.


[EXCERPT:ConstructionScript]
The ConstructionScript function is executed whenever an instance of this Blueprint is placed or modified. It allows you to do several powerful things:

* Configure components inside your Blueprint based on the value of exposed variables.
* Create components through programming allowing for procedural content.
* Modify the blueprint based on the scene (e.g. results of line traces).

[EXCERPT:EventGraph]
An Event Graph allows you to place many types of nodes to create different behaviors. Event graphs are very flexible and can have multiple Event nodes to start execution, nodes that take time to execute (e.g. Delay), as well as Timeline nodes.

[EXCERPT:FunctionGraph]
A Function Graph allows you to encapsulate functionality and re-use it. Function graphs have a single input and output node with a single execution pin, but you can add as many input and output data pins as you like. Functions cannot contain any nodes that take time (e.g. Delay or Timelines) or Event nodes. You can add temporary 'local variable' nodes to a Function, but they will be wiped when the function is completed.

You can drag-and-drop a Function from the MyBlueprint tab into the graph area to create a use of that function.

[EXCERPT:MacroGraph]
A Macro Graph allows you to encapsulate functionality and re-use it. Macros have a single input and output node, but you can add as many input and output pins as you like (including execution pins). Macro's can contain nodes that take time (e.g. Delay) but can not contain Timeline or Event nodes. You can add 'local variable' nodes to a Macro, and their value will persist when the macro is complete.

[EXCERPT:AnimGraph]
An AnimGraph is a special graph used to blend Animations together. White lines in an AnimGraph represent animated poses being blended, not execution flow.

[EXCERPT:StateMachine]
A State Machine graph is used as part of the animation system to play animations (and transitions) in response to a set of transition rules.

[EXCERPT:Variable]
A variable is used to store data inside your Blueprint.

You can drag variables around in the MyBlueprint tab to change their order and category. You can also drag them into the graph area to add a 'get' or 'set' node for that variable. Dragging a variable onto the pin of a node will create a 'get' or 'set' node connected to that pin (if possible). Dragging a variable onto an existing get or set node will change that node to use the new variable instead.

Selecting a variable will let you edit its name, type, tooltip, etc in the Details tab.

[EXCERPT:Event]
An Event is a node that starts execution in an Event Graph in response to some action. This might be a key being pressed, or a trigger being overlapped.

[/EXCERPT:Event]

[EXCERPT:LocalVariable]
Local variables are variables that exist only within the scope of the function that they are created in, and the data is not persistent between calls of the functions.
