[EXCERPT:MyBlueprint]
The MyBlueprint tab is used to manage all the different elements of your Blueprint. It is broken into sections for Graphs, Functions, Macros, Variables and Event Dispatchers. Double-clicking on a Graph, Function, or Macro will open it for editing in a new tab. You can use the 'Add' buttons at the top to create new elements for your Blueprint. Graphs show all the Event nodes within them as well. Variables can be dragged around in the list to change their order and category. You can also drag Functions, Macros, Variables, and Event Dispatchers into a graph to add a node using them.
