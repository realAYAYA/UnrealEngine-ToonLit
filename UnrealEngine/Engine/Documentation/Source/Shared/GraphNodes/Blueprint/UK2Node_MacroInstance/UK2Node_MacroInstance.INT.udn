Description:Overview of Blueprint macro nodes.

[EXCERPT:ForEachLoop]


The ForEachLoop node allows you to execute some set of Blueprint functionality on each individual entry in an array.

The 'Loop Body' output sends an execution pulse for each entry in the 'Array' input. When an execution pulse is sent down from 'Loop Body', then 'Array Element' is outputting one of the array's elements (whichever one it is currently focused on). 'Array Index' will be that element's position in the array (it is zero based, so the first element will yield 0, the second: 1, third: 2, etc.).

The ForEachLoop node is a macro node. You can double-click macro nodes to see how they are constructed.

The 'Completed' execution output receives a pulse when the node has gone through every element in the 'Array'.

[EXCERPT:DoOnce]


The DoOnce node lets you execute some set of Blueprint functionality once and never again. 

When the DoOnce node is fed an execution pulse, the node will only output that pulse (through the 'Completed' output) if it has not done so before (or if it has been reset). Once a pulse has ran through it once, its logic-gate is considered "closed" (and another pulse will not filter through).

If you set the 'Start Closed' input, you start the DoOnce logic-gate closed (meaning from the start it will not let any pulses through). To open the gate again, for a single pulse to flow through, you must run an execution pulse to the 'Reset' input.

The DoOnce node is a macro node. You can double-click macro nodes to see how they are constructed.
