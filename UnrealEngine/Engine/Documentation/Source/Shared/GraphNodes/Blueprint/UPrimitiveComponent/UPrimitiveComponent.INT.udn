[EXCERPT:K2_LineTraceComponent]

When executed, this node performs a ray-cast along a line (defined by the 'Trace Start' and 'Trace End' inputs). If the line intersects with the specified 'Target' component, then the hit's location and normal are returned via the 'Hit Location' and 'Hit Normal' pins.

You can opt to test against either complex or simplified collision (with the 'Trace Complex' input). Using complex collision is more precise, but slower and more performance intensive.

You can easily check if the trace turned up a hit by checking the 'Return Value' output (_True_ if anything was hit, _False_ if not). If the 'Return Value' is _false_, then 'Hit Location' and 'Hit Normal' are zero vectors.
