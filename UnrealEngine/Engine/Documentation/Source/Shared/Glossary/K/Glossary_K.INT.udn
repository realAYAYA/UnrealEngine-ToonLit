[EXCERPT:Glossary_Key]
In animation, a **key** or **keyframe** is a record of a given value or values at a specific time. Curves are then used to interpolate between these keyframes, resulting in animated change over time.
[/EXCERPT:Glossary_Key]
[EXCERPT:Glossary_keybindings]
**Keybindings** are custom-defined keyboard shortcuts. In the Unreal Engine, you can bind specific keys or key combinations to execute specific commands or actions.

[EXCERPT:Glossary_Kill_Z]
The **Kill Z** is the coordinate along the Z axis at which an Actor is automatically destroyed or players are killed. Setting a Kill Z helps prevent player characters from getting stuck and being unable to respawn when they fall off an edge.
