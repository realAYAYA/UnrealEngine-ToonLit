[EXCERPT:Glossary_Flow_Control]
**Flow Control** operations allow the flow of execution to be controlled explicitly in Blueprints. This control can be in the form of choosing one branch of the graph to execute based on whether some condition 
is true, executing a specific branch multiple times, executing multiple branches in a specific order, 
and so on. The default flow control operations include branches (if statements), loops (for and while), 
gates, and sequences.

[EXCERPT:Glossary_framework]
The **framework** systems form the foundation of gameplay in the Unreal Engine. The gameplay framework can be divided into three categories: gametype, player, and interface. Each of these is responsible for a particular aspect of the gameplay and each is comprised of one or more systems and classes that define the different parts and how they work together.
