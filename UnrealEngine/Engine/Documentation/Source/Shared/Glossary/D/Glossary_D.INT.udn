![Blueprint Data Pin Types](k2_pins_data_types.png)

**Data pins** are used for taking data into a node or outputting data from a node. Data pins are type-specific and can be wired to variables of the same type (which have data pins of their own) or a data pin of the same type on another node. Like execution pins, data pins are displayed as an outline when not wired to anything, and solid when wired.

![Blueprint Data Pins](k2_pins_data.png)

Nodes can have any number of input or output data pins. The data pins of a Function Call node correspond to the parameters and return value of the corresponding function.

[EXCERPT:Glossary_Defaults_Mode]
The **Class Defaults** or **Defaults** mode displays all of the properties of the _Blueprint_, including variables 
contained within the _Blueprint_ and components defined in native code as well as replication, navigation, 
and collision properties. The values set for these properties in the Defaults mode will be 
used when new instances of the _Blueprint_ are created.
