[EXCERPT:Glossary_Material]
A **Material** is an asset that can be applied to a mesh to control the visual look of the scene. At a high level, it is probably easiest to think of a Material as the "paint" that is applied to an object. But even that can be a little misleading, since a Material literally defines the type of surface from which your object appears to be made. You can define its color, how shiny it is, whether you can see through the object, and much more. 

In more technical terms, when light from the scene hits the surface, a Material is used to calculate how that light interacts with that surface. These calculations are done using incoming data that is input to the Material from a variety of images (textures) and math expressions, as well as from various property settings inherent to the Material itself.

Unreal Engine utilizes a _physically-based shading model_. This means that rather than defining a Material using arbitrary properties (such as Diffuse Color and Specular Power), you instead use properties more easily relatable to the real world. These include Base Color, Metallic, Specular, and Roughness.

[EXCERPT:Glossary_Matinee]
The **Matinee** animation tool provides the ability to animate the properties of Actors over time, to create either dynamic gameplay or cinematic in-game sequences. The system is based on the use of specialized animation tracks in which you can place keyframes to set the values of certain properties of the Actors in the level. The Matinee Editor is similar to the non-linear editors used for video editing, making it familiar to video professionals.
[/EXCERPT:Glossary_Matinee]
[EXCERPT:Glossary_Matinee_Actor]
A **Matinee Actor** is a specific instance of a Matinee animation, created as an Actor and placed in your scene.
[/EXCERPT:Glossary_Matinee_Actor]
[EXCERPT:Glossary_Migrate_Tool]
The **Content Browser** contains the **Migrate Tool**, which allows assets to be copied from one project to another, along with any dependent assets. For instance, you can migrate a Material, and any Texture assets that define that Material will automatically be copied along with it. This is useful when you need to merge or fork projects, or when transitioning from a test environment into a production project.

[EXCERPT:Glossary_Mobility]
**Mobility** is a property of Static Mesh and Light Actors. The Mobility property, which is set in the **Details** panel, determines whether an Actor can move during gameplay. In addition, for Light Actors, the Mobility property determines the types of light and shadows cast.  Mobility property settings include Static, Stationary (Light Actors only), and Movable.

In the World Outliner, an Actor's Mobility setting is indicated by a small colored dot on the left: orange for Movable, yellow for Stationary, none for Static.

Actors with a Movable setting have the most versatility but the highest performance hit; Actors with a Static setting have the least versatility but the lowest performance hit.

[EXCERPT:Glossary_Modes_panel]
The **Modes** panel contains a selection of various tool modes for the Editor. These change the primary behavior of the Level Editor for a specialized task, such as placing new assets into the world, creating geometry brushes and volumes, painting on meshes, generating foliage, and sculpting landscapes.
[/EXCERPT:Glossary_Modes_panel]
[EXCERPT:Glossary_Movable]
**Movable** is one possible Mobility property settings. This setting can be applied to both Static Mesh and Light Actors.

**Movable Static Mesh Actors** can be moved during gameplay, and can interact with other Actors.

[INCLUDE:#Glossary_Movable_Lights]

Movable Lights can change position, rotation, color, brightness, falloff, radius, and just about every other property they have.
[/EXCERPT:Glossary_Movable]
[EXCERPT:Glossary_Movable_Lights]
**Movable Lights** are lights that can be moved and changed in game. Typical uses would be headlights on a car, flashlights, light fixtures that sway in the wind, and so on. Movable Lights are completely dynamic, and do not support indirect lighting at the moment.  Movable lights use dynamic shadowing for the entire scene.  As a result, shadow casting movable lights can cost 20x more than a Stationary light.

Of the three light mobilities, Movable lights tend to have medium quality, highest mutability, and the highest performance cost.

[EXCERPT:Glossary_Move_tool]
The **Move tool** is a transformation widget that you can use to move (translate) Actors in your scene along the X, Y, and Z axes.
