[EXCERPT:Glossary_GameMode]
The **GameMode** Class is responsible for setting the rules of the game that is being played. The rules can include how players join the game, whether or not a game can be paused, and level transitions, as well as any game-specific behavior such as win conditions. 

You can set the default GameMode in the **Project Settings**, but can override it on a per-Level basis. Regardless of how you choose to implement the GameMode, there is always only one GameMode present per-level. In a multiplayer game, the GameMode only exists on the server and the rules are replicated (sent) to each of the connected clients. 

[/EXCERPT:Glossary_GameMode]
[EXCERPT:Glossary_GameState]
The **GameState** contains the information that you want replicated to every client in a game, or more simply it is 'The State of the Game' for everyone connected. 

It often contains information about game score, whether a match has started or not, how many AI to spawn based upon the number of players in the world, and other game specific information. 

For mutliplayer games, there is one instance of the GameState on each player's machine with the server's instance being the authoritative one (or the one that clients get their updated information from).

[EXCERPT:Glossary_Graph_Mode]
The **Graph** is a visual representation of a particular graph of nodes as it shows 
all of the nodes contained in the graph as well as the connections between them. It provides 
editing capabilities for adding and removing nodes, arranging nodes, and creating links between 
nodes. Breakpoints can also be set in the Graph to aid in [debugging](Engine/Blueprints\UserGuide\Debugging) Blueprints.

[EXCERPT:Glossary_group]
In Matinee, a **group** is a container for animation and visual effects for a specific Actor. In the Level Editor, a **group** is an organizational object in which selected Actors can be combined together so they can be transformed as a single unit.
